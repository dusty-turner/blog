The hijackers forced the pilots to divert the airplane to Palma de Mallorca, Spain.  The perpetrators threatened to blow up the airplane if their demands  were not met.  These demands included the release of political prisoners, the resumption of the cancelled 1991 Algerian elections, as well as being granted asylum in Spain.  Following an eight hour standoff, the assailants released the forty-two hostages aboard the airplane unharmed and turned themselves in to Spanish authorities.  The hijackers were identified as Merzak Benachour, Madjid Arab and Mohammed Nedjar.  All three individuals proclaimed to be part of the Union of Peaceful Citizens of Algeria.",hijack
