      <description>IntroductionOver Christmas 2017, my wife, Jill, resolved that our family (to include babysitters) would read our children over 1000 new books in 2018. More specifically, 29 December 2017 - 28 December 2018.
A goal like this takes dedication, love, and of course, a Data Science-y approach.
Special thanks to Ally, Zia, and Bookbuddy for help in accomplishing this goal!
Also, special thanks to drob and juliasilge who privde the tidytext package and the entire R open-source community I rely on to do this analysis.</description>

      <description>A Little About Dates in RBefore we launch into any analysis that contains dates, we should know a few important nuggets about how R handles date-like objects.
There are 3 date/time classes are built in to R
- Date
- POSIXct
- POSIXlt
Base RFirst, base R can read a string of text and convert it to a date class. To help it read the date, you must tell R what date format your character string should expect.</description>

      <description>IntroductionA colleague of mine asked me to help him explore a dataset in R. He has little experience in R, so I will provide as much detail as I can in this exploration. My goal here is to make this post both ‘learn-able’ and ‘replicable’.
