      <description>Accessing ESPN’s New V3 API for Private Leagues: How We Got HereThis marks post 3 of n of my 2019 ESPN Fantasy Football blog posts. In the last few months, ESPN upgraded their API from V2 to V3, breaking all of our previous work accessing and analysing the data from the API.
In my last two posts, I explored how to access data from ESPN’s V3 API for public leagues.</description>

      <description>Accessing ESPN Fantasy Football for Private LeaguesIn my previous post, I explained how to access the ESPN Fantasy Football’s new (V3) public API. But what if your league manager does not make the league public? Are you out of luck?
In this post I’ll explain how to pass ‘cookies’ to ESPN and access private league data.
To accomplish this, we’ll use…

      <description>ESPN’s New API (V3)In previous seasons, we’ve enjoyed relatively easy access to ESPN’s fantasy sports data. Sometime in the last few months, ESPN altered/upgraded their AP to V3.
As I’ve tried to replicate previous analysis, old methods accessing the V2 API no longer work.

      <description>IntroductionFor the last two years I’ve had the honor of being the commissioner for the West Point Department of Mathematical Science’s Fantasy Football League. This year we had 20 managers so we had to split our department into two leagues. I hosted one using ESPN and a colleague hosted on in Yahoo.
In order to compare our two leagues, I will use the ESPN API and YAHOO API to download our league’s information.</description>

      <description>Bowl Season!Its one of the best times of the year. In order to celebrate (and to participate in a little competition), I put together a Shiny App to track my collegues picks over the season.

      <description>IntroductionLets see who really has fantasy football bragging rights and who is just lucky (or unlucky).
During this analysis I will display most of my code. While this doesn’t provided the most pleasent visual experience, it will hopefully help the reader learn from my examples. (And potentially provide feedback on how to improve my methods.)
LibrariesThe libraries I will use for this analysis are the following:</description>
