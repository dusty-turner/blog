      <description>It is our last summer at West Point! We will sure miss our cadets. To keep touch with everyone, I’ve created a ShinyApp (embedded below) that shows the location (and dates) of everyone over the summer training period.
If you’d rather view the app outside the blog, here is the link

      <description>BackgroundOne of my son’s favorite games he received for Christmas this year is UNO Attack. If you are not familiar with the rules, you can get up to speed here. In short, the rules are no different than usual UNO except when you cannot play, instead of taking a card, you press a button on an UNO card shooting contraption. Most of the time you get no cards, but some of the time it will “attack” with 1 or more cards.</description>
