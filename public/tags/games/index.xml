      <description>Hi all, thanks for participating in the prop bets for the 2019 Super Bowl.
During my ear recovery, I accumulated some fun prop “bets” (no money is involved) for the upcoming Super Bowl to make the game more fun and interesting. Questions range from “Who will be the winner” to “How long will the National Anthem Last” to “What color will the post-game Gatorade bath be”?

      <description>BackgroundOne of my son’s favorite games he received for Christmas this year is UNO Attack. If you are not familiar with the rules, you can get up to speed here. In short, the rules are no different than usual UNO except when you cannot play, instead of taking a card, you press a button on an UNO card shooting contraption. Most of the time you get no cards, but some of the time it will “attack” with 1 or more cards.</description>
