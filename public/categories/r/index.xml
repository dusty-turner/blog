      <description>As I mentioned in a previous blog post, my family and I have found different activities to do as all our other activities are on hold due to the COVID-19 lockdown.
In that post, I looked at first player’s strategy when spinning the big wheel prior to the showcase showdown.
In this post, I’ll explore the rarely won game, Pay the Rent
Pay The RentPay The RentPay The Rent is a challenging game.</description>

      <description>Its that time of year!Its that time of year again. The time when we dust off the old ESPN fantasy football API R code and fix everything that broke in the last year.
Here’s what I hope to show over the next few posts.
How to access your ESPN public fantasy football league’s data.How to organize that data and create a few interesting displays.How to create a dashboard to supplement your league’s fun.</description>

      <description>IntroductionOver Christmas 2017, my wife, Jill, resolved that our family (to include babysitters) would read our children over 1000 new books in 2018. More specifically, 29 December 2017 - 28 December 2018.
A goal like this takes dedication, love, and of course, a Data Science-y approach.
Special thanks to Ally, Zia, and Bookbuddy for help in accomplishing this goal!
Also, special thanks to drob and juliasilge who privde the tidytext package and the entire R open-source community I rely on to do this analysis.</description>

      <description>Bowl Season!Its one of the best times of the year. In order to celebrate (and to participate in a little competition), I put together a Shiny App to track my collegues picks over the season. Its improved throughout the season, and there are still improvment’s I’d like to add - but below is a working prototype.

      <description>Midway through my first semester teaching at West Point, my mentor, asked me what “scholarship” I was working on. To be honest, at the time, I was doing my best to make sure I understood what material I was teaching the next day and making sure my grading was up-to-date. I had been tinkering around with the idea of ‘data scraping’ which was a nebulous term to be then. I was intrigued by it and had google searched ways to get data in the days before (my old tried and true method of copy and paste was frustratingly slow…).</description>

      <description>IntroductionA colleague of mine asked me to help him explore a dataset in R. He has little experience in R, so I will provide as much detail as I can in this exploration. My goal here is to make this post both ‘learn-able’ and ‘replicable’.

      <description>IntroductionLets see who really has fantasy football bragging rights and who is just lucky (or unlucky).
During this analysis I will display most of my code. While this doesn’t provided the most pleasent visual experience, it will hopefully help the reader learn from my examples. (And potentially provide feedback on how to improve my methods.)
LibrariesThe libraries I will use for this analysis are the following:</description>

      <description>As my experience with statistics, computer science, and the all encompasing term, data science, increases, I have decided that it is time to share some of my projects.
Creating this blog serves several purposes.
It archives some projects I’ve created.It makes my work public so I can receive (hopefully) constructive feedback to improve my tools/analysis.
It helps me share what I’ve learned with the community that has been so helpful to me.</description>
