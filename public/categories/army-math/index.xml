      <description>As my experience with statistics, computer science, and the all encompasing term, data science, increases, I have decided that it is time to share some of my projects.
Creating this blog serves several purposes.
It archives some projects I’ve created.It makes my work public so I can receive (hopefully) constructive feedback to improve my tools/analysis.
It helps me share what I’ve learned with the community that has been so helpful to me.</description>
