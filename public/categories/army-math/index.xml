      <title>Fantasy Football - Navigating the ESPN and Yahoo! APIs</title>

      <description>IntroductionFor the last two years I’ve had the honor of being the commissioner for the West Point Department of Mathematical Science’s Fantasy Football League. This year we had 20 managers so we had to split our department into two leagues. I hosted one using ESPN and a colleague hosted on in Yahoo.
In order to compare our two leagues, I will use the ESPN API and YAHOO API to download our league’s information.</description>

      <description>IntroductionIn my previous post, I worked through how to get your league information from the ESPN and YAHOO APIs.
The motivation for this project was to compare two leagues performances over the 2018 fantasy football season. As the ring leader of the West Point Department of Mathematical Sciences fantasy football league, we had 20 managers. This, of course, is too many for one league so we split the teams across two leagues.</description>

In order to celebrate (and to participate in a little competition), I put together a Shiny App to track my collegues picks over the season.

      <description>IntroductionLets see who really has fantasy football bragging rights and who is just lucky (or unlucky).
During this analysis I will display most of my code. While this doesn’t provided the most pleasent visual experience, it will hopefully help the reader learn from my examples. (And potentially provide feedback on how to improve my methods.)
LibrariesThe libraries I will use for this analysis are the following:</description>

      <description>As my experience with statistics, computer science, and the all encompasing term, data science, increases, I have decided that it is time to share some of my projects.
Creating this blog serves several purposes.
It archives some projects I’ve created.It makes my work public so I can receive (hopefully) constructive feedback to improve my tools/analysis.
It helps me share what I’ve learned with the community that has been so helpful to me.</description>
