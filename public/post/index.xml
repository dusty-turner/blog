      <description>As I mentioned in a previous blog post, my family and I have found different activities to do as all our other activities are on hold due to the COVID-19 lockdown.
In that post, I looked at first player’s strategy when spinning the big wheel prior to the showcase showdown.
In this post, I’ll explore the rarely won game, Pay the Rent

      <description>In 2018, my wife and I were fortunate enough to find a deeply discounted Peloton on an online garage sale. Since then, she’s been going hard and I have been trying to keep up when the weather is bad or injuries keep me from running.

      <description>MotivationLike many, COVID-19 completely altered our lives as the virus spread across the country and became a mainstay in our society. Though my family and I have been spared of tragedy, we’ve had to find ways to replace kid’s activities, work routines, and social interactions with other (hopefully) enriching activities… Like family games.

      <description>A Tribute!Since the dawn of time, people have been developing human-like attachments to their transportation. I imagine Moses naming his chariot, Noah his ark, and maybe even Jesus naming his borrowed donkey.
Well, maybe I’m taking too much historical license, but man’s affinity for their transportation remains.

      <description>The Goal of this AnalysisOne of my superpowers is being a bad fantasy football manager. My motivation for this analysis is to show how I’m not actually that bad - but rather unlucky. To show this, I created this post.
Below I summarize how I got the data, the information I can glean from the data, share the link to this analysis for my league, and share the code so you can do it to.</description>

      <description>Accessing ESPN’s New V3 API for Private Leagues: How We Got HereThis marks post 3 of n of my 2019 ESPN Fantasy Football blog posts. In the last few months, ESPN upgraded their API from V2 to V3, breaking all of our previous work accessing and analysing the data from the API.
In my last two posts, I explored how to access data from ESPN’s V3 API for public leagues.</description>

      <description>Accessing ESPN Fantasy Football for Private LeaguesIn my previous post, I explained how to access the ESPN Fantasy Football’s new (V3) public API. But what if your league manager does not make the league public? Are you out of luck?
In this post I’ll explain how to pass ‘cookies’ to ESPN and access private league data.

      <description>ESPN’s New API (V3)In previous seasons, we’ve enjoyed relatively easy access to ESPN’s fantasy sports data. Sometime in the last few months, ESPN altered/upgraded their AP to V3.
As I’ve tried to replicate previous analysis, old methods accessing the V2 API no longer work.

      <description>IntroductionOften times, I run simulations on my computer to help educate my students about different statistical topics. In doing this, I often end up running fairly “long” simulations that take up more time than what I’d like to use in the classrooms.
Complaining about this let me to Googling, which, as usual, let me to a solution. Posted below is an example of what I learned with an accompanying ShinyApp which helps me explain bootstrapping to my students.</description>

      <description>Hi all, thanks for participating in the prop bets for the 2019 Super Bowl.
During my ear recovery, I accumulated some fun prop “bets” (no money is involved) for the upcoming Super Bowl to make the game more fun and interesting. Questions range from “Who will be the winner” to “How long will the National Anthem Last” to “What color will the post-game Gatorade bath be”?

      <description>BackgroundOne of my son’s favorite games he received for Christmas this year is UNO Attack. If you are not familiar with the rules, you can get up to speed here. In short, the rules are no different than usual UNO except when you cannot play, instead of taking a card, you press a button on an UNO card shooting contraption. Most of the time you get no cards, but some of the time it will “attack” with 1 or more cards.</description>

      <description>IntroductionFor the last two years I’ve had the honor of being the commissioner for the West Point Department of Mathematical Science’s Fantasy Football League. This year we had 20 managers so we had to split our department into two leagues. I hosted one using ESPN and a colleague hosted on in Yahoo.
In order to compare our two leagues, I will use the ESPN API and YAHOO API to download our league’s information.</description>

      <description>IntroductionIn my previous post, I worked through how to get your league information from the ESPN and YAHOO APIs.
The motivation for this project was to compare two leagues performances over the 2018 fantasy football season. As the ring leader of the West Point Department of Mathematical Sciences fantasy football league, we had 20 managers. This, of course, is too many for one league so we split the teams across two leagues.</description>

A goal like this takes dedication, love, and of course, a Data Science-y approach.
Special thanks to Ally, Zia, and Bookbuddy for help in accomplishing this goal!
Also, special thanks to drob and juliasilge who privde the tidytext package and the entire R open-source community I rely on to do this analysis.</description>

      <description>In February 2006, my dad and I split the cost of a 2005 Ford F150. He probably paid the larger half, but I believe he (and I) have got our money’s worth out of it as I still drive it to this day. Since the purchase, I have tracked the gas mileage every time I’ve filled up the tank. This tutorial uses this data set to highlight some functions in R to do the following:</description>

      <description>A Little About Dates in RBefore we launch into any analysis that contains dates, we should know a few important nuggets about how R handles date-like objects.
There are 3 date/time classes are built in to R
- Date
- POSIXct
- POSIXlt
Base RFirst, base R can read a string of text and convert it to a date class. To help it read the date, you must tell R what date format your character string should expect.</description>

      <description>Midway through my first semester teaching at West Point, my mentor, asked me what “scholarship” I was working on. To be honest, at the time, I was doing my best to make sure I understood what material I was teaching the next day and making sure my grading was up-to-date. I had been tinkering around with the idea of ‘data scraping’ which was a nebulous term to be then. I was intrigued by it and had google searched ways to get data in the days before (my old tried and true method of copy and paste was frustratingly slow…).</description>
