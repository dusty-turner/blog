<h2>Its that time of year!</h2>
<p>Its that time of year again. The time when we dust off the old ESPN fantasy football API R code and fix everything that broke in the last year.</p>
<p>Here’s what I hope to show over the next few posts.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How to access your ESPN public fantasy football league’s data.</li>
<li>How to organize that data and create a few interesting displays.</li>
<li>How to create a dashboard to supplement your league’s fun.</li>
</ol>
<p>My ultimate goal is to build this into a package on Github. I’ve got that started, but its currently a work in progress.</p>
<p>All this code and more is located at my <a href="https://github.com/dusty-turner/fantasyfootball2020">github</a>.</p>
<p>And a special thanks to my friend and collaborator <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jim-pleuss-0a10bb81/">Jim Pleuss</a> who really enhanced so much of this project!</p>
</div>
<div id="a-little-background" class="section level2">
<h2>A little background</h2>
<p>This ESPN API exploration is a fun annual process. I first started doing this in <a href="https://www.dustysturner.com/post/espn-yahoo-api-navigation/">2018</a>. In 2019, after some hacking and some updates, I posted about how to access <a href="https://www.dustysturner.com/post/espn-fantasy-football-v3-api-an-r-solution/">public leagues</a>, how to access <a href="https://www.dustysturner.com/post/espn-fantasy-football-v3-api-for-private-leagues-python-through-r/">private leagues using reticulate and python</a>, and how to access <a href="https://www.dustysturner.com/post/espn-fantasy-football-v3-api-for-private-leagues-an-r-solution-finally/">private leagues in R</a>. I went so far last year as to <a href="https://www.dustysturner.com/post/fantasy-football-2019-analysis/">build a dashboard</a> with the data to further analyze my league.</p>
<p>Well, in 2020, ESPN changed their some of their end points. After a lot of exploration and the help of Chrome’s inspect tool, I present code to access ESPN’s API. This <em>should</em> work for any league. If you find it does not work for your league, I’d be happy to take a pull request or two to handle more nuances.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-access-the-api" class="section level2">
<h2>How to access the API</h2>
<p>In the function below, you provide arguments for your leagueID and the week of the information you would like to extract.</p>
<p>To find your leagueID, look at the URL of your fantasy football home page on ESPN.</p>
<p>The output of this function will be a JSON file. I provide code to explore the JSON file as well.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(gt)

season, Kamara couldn't repeat his incredible 18-TD performance from 2018 -- and injuries certainly played their part. That said, he was always due for a bit of regression in the scoring department. He still managed a healthy 18 points per game and hopes to be healthy heading into Week 1 against the Buccaneers, who were strong against the run but not against the pass in 2019. Since Kamara can make things happen in both phases of the game, he's still a solid RB1 option in fantasy.","Hopkins has thrived with varying levels of quality at quarterback in his career. Now he gets the chance to line up alongside a rising star in Kyler Murray. That should be a great opportunity for the veteran out of Clemson.  He gets a perfectly fine matchup against a decent 49ers pass defense (12th-fewest WR points allowed last year) in Week 1. He's a must-start every week, and this is no exception.","Evans or Godwin? In most weeks, we're going to say both. With Tom Brady under center, you can expect both of the Buccaneers' elite receivers to get plenty of good looks. Evans had his ups and downs last season, but if you locked him into your lineup when he was healthy, you were happy with the end results. Well, he's healthy and ready to go for Week 1, so he's an easy pick as a WR1.","Thielen was the star of the Minnesota passing game in 2018, but he was beseiged by injuries in 2019 and never found consistent playing time as a result. Reports from camp are encouraging and it seems like the 30-year-old is back and ready to go for 2020 -- and he'll be needed. With Stefon Diggs no longer on the team, Thielen is truly the star of the show in the passing game. He's a WR1 this week against the rival Packers.","Posting awesome per-touch metrics at Wisconsin and the fastest 40 among running back prospects at the 2020 combine, Taylor enters the NFL with some appealing upside. Without any preseason games to provide information, it's unclear just how the workload share between Taylor and Marlon Mack will play out. Given that the Jaguars allowed nearly 26 fantasy points per game to backs last season, it's likely that Taylor can provide flex-worthy production even amid a timeshare with Mack to begin his career.","If you can set aside the contract drama and only consider Prescott's performance and surrounding cast, he's a lock to start every week for your fantasy squad. He took a step forward in 2019, posting career-highs in both yards and touchdowns through the air, resulting in the best fantasy scoring average of his career. He should do more of the same in 2020, starting with Week 1 against a Rams team that ranked near the middle of the pack in stopping the pass a year ago.","Welcome back to fantasy football, where figuring out which San Francisco running back will do best this week often means the difference between a win and a loss. Mostert certainly had a breakout season a year ago, but his overall volume was still very low. Perhaps his huge performance in the NFC Championship Game against the Packers will earn him more playing time in 2020, but there's still a big risk. He's worth a spot in your lineup as a flex for now. If you do opt to sit him in Week 1, definitely hold onto him in case he earns a more full-time gig.","Going from a completion machine of a quarterback to Josh Allen isn't exactly an upgrade for Diggs, but there is at least seemingly increased potential for big plays given Buffalo's bolder downfield approach. The Jets were middle-of-the-league in most defensive metrics facing receivers last season and experienced a sizable downgrade at safety over the summer. Add this all up and Diggs is a solid third receiver or flex option for his Buffalo debut.","The top three receivers for the Giants appear to be the same as last season, with Shepard, Golden Tate and Darius Slayton competing for passes from Daniel Jones. However, Saquon Barkley and Evan Engram also factor into that equation, and none of the receivers stand out quite enough on their own to merit a strong recommendation for your fantasy lineup. Shepard is a reliable player and is an option for the flex spot in most leagues, but don't ramp up your expectations too high.","A talented big-play threat from the tight end position, Henry enters his fifth year in the league with a new quarterback but a similar role as the team's top option over the middle. There is some risk present in that Henry is playing with a new quarterback, but a friendly matchup against a porous Bengals pass defense helps his case ","Murray has been a productive running back over the past couple of seasons despite inconsistent playing time, and he's exactly the sort of back to keep stashed away on your bench. When he's starting, Murray is worth having in your lineup, but unless Alvin Kamara is out for Week 1, you'll probably find many better options for your fantasy lineup.","Rodgers took a bit of a step back in 2019, and it's hard to imagine that his lackluster receiving corps wasn't the reason why. The veteran has lost a bit of efficiency, to be fair, as his 62% completion rate was definitely on the low side. Even so, we can still expect him to deliver the occasional big game -- just maybe not against the Vikings. Minnesota held Rodgers to only two touchdowns across their two meetings in 2019, making him a very risky QB start in Week 1 against this same team.","Tom Brady and the Buccaneers will head to New Orleans to open the season, and it will be an immediate test for a solid but not spectacular D/ST that finished eighth a year ago in fantasy points. This isn't the best matchup, but a home game against an offense with a lot of moving pieces compared to last season isn't the worst option either.",null,"One of several young backs contending for exposure in a somewhat murky Jacksonville backfield, Robinson enters this division matchup with the Colts as a deep-league stash."],"2":["A pair of scores -- one on the ground and the other in the air -- salvaged an otherwise blasÃ© opener for Kamara as he averaged a paltry 1.3 yards on 12 carries to go along with five catches for 51 yards against an improving Tampa Bay defense. Kamara should be more productive in Week 2 as he draws a more generous Raiders unit. As always, feel free to start your fantasy first rounder with confidence.","Hopkins found immediate chemistry with his new QB, Kyler Murray, hauling in an incredible 14 passes against a tough 49ers defense. Expect more of the same in Week 2 against a less-impressive Washington pass defense. Consider Hopkins to be a top-tier option heading into Week 2.","Evans was a game-time decision for Week 1 and, although he played, it was clear the star wideout wasnâ€™t 100%. Adding to the misery was that he still drew coverage from Marshon Lattimore. The end result was just one catch, albeit for a late touchdown. Another week to get better should serve Evans well as Tampa Bay gets ready to face a weak Panthers defense in the Buccaneers' home opener. Despite Week 1's performance, if Evans is active for Tampa Bay, he should be active for you.","When healthy, Thielen is one of the most dependable wideouts in the NFL -- and he proved that again in Week 1. He hauled in six of his eight targets for a pair of scores and a healthy yardage total. He'll get a chance to do the same in Week 2 against a Colts defense that allowed three Jaguars passing touchdowns to open the 2020 season. Lock him in as a WR1 for this week.","Philip Rivers often flirts with the league lead for targets to running backs, so it was fun to see Taylor targeted on six of his 12 routes in Week 1. It took an injury to Marlon Mack to unleash Taylor as the team's leading rushing option going forward, but there is undeniable upside for this gifted rookie against a Vikings defense that struggled in Week 1. ","While Prescottâ€™s Week 1 performance wasnâ€™t terrible, a consensus top-five fantasy quarterback is expected to give you more than just 266 yards passing and only one touchdown. Week 2 should be an improvement as he will take the helm against a Falcons secondary that just allowed Russell Wilson to have a 322-yard, 4-TD day. Despite the lackluster opener, Prescott remains one of the top fantasy QB options .","Mostert handled the bulk of the work at running back for the 49ers in Week 1 -- a great sign that 2019's breakout star might actually get a healthy workload this season and become a fantasy mainstay. He was especially effective in the passing game, so if George Kittle misses any time due to injury, we could see Mostert chip in even more as a pass-catcher in Week 2. Either way, he's a rock-solid option as an RB2 even against a Jets team that was solid against the run a year ago, though not to a concerning degree.","Some optimistic indicators emerged from Diggs' debut with Buffalo; not only did he deliver a solid eight-catch showing, but he promisingly led the team in air yards per target, as well. This signals some big yardage outings could be on the way. The Dolphins claim some real talent at outside corner, but Diggs' featured role figures to sustain a solid floor.","Shepard caught an efficient six balls on six targets, but for only 7.8 yards per reception, demonstrating he was primarily used as an underneath receiver. That said, this is nothing new to Shepard and his consistency is useful in leagues with PPR scoring. Consider Shepard to be a solid flex option, albeit with limited upside, when the Giants visit Chicago in Week 2. There, they'll be taking on a Bears defense that allowed the fourth-most total yards in Week 1.","A strong showing from Henry fueled by seven targets and 36 yards after the catch against the Bengals indicates he's firmly in the starting tier at the position for this matchup with a Chiefs secondary that struggled against tight ends dating back to last season.","Murrayâ€™s rushing workload was a bit higher than last seasonâ€™s average number of weekly touches, but his yards-per-carry was a middling 3.2, compared to 4.4 for 2019. He also saw just one unsuccessful target sent in his direction. There will be weeks when Murray is a deep flex option, but this isnâ€™t one of them.","Rodgers was able to find his connection to Davante Adams early and often to begin the new season, and he helped lead the Packers to a prolific day on offense to open the campaign. Meanwhile, the Lions were allowing three touchdown passes to Mitchell Trubisky and seem to have some injury issues in the secondary. This all sets up well for a vintage Rodgers performance in Week 2. He's a solid option to start in most fantasy leagues.","Buoyed by a pair of interceptions off Tom Brady -- including one returned for a touchdown -- the Saints were one of the better fantasy defenses in the opening week. Week 2 presents them with a battle against an improving Raiders offense. Let's consider the Saints D/ST to be one to start only if you don't have another (better) alternative. ",null,"Ninety scrimmage yards in his debut as the team's primary rusher is an impressive feat for Robinson. With 56 of his rushing yards coming after initial contact, Robinson proved capable of navigating a solid NFL defense. The Titans allowed 4.4 yards per carry this past week, with Robinson positioned as a daring flex play this week. "],"3":["Kamara was the chief beneficiary of Michael Thomas' absence on Monday night with 22 touches for 174 yards-from-scrimmage and a pair of rushing touchdowns. Kamara was especially productive as a receiver and is in a good spot to do so again against Green Bay in Week 3. Kamara is matchup-proof with a good chance to be the No. 1 overall running back in Week 3.","Hopkins took a step back in Week 2, \"only\" scoring one touchdown on nine targets, eight of which were caught. Through two weeks, the former Texans star has at least double the receptions, targets and yards of any other Arizona pass-catcher. He remains the top option in an offense on the rise under second-year passer Kyler Murray. Against a porous Detroit defense, Hopkins is an elite WR1 for Week 3.","That's more like it! After playing with a sore hamstring in the 2020 opener, Evans showed no ill effects in Week 2 with a 104-yard effort on seven catches, including a score. A repeat is possible with the Buccaneers facing the Broncos, who have surrendered the ninth-most WR receiving yards to go along with four touchdowns. Several wide receivers are in a favorable spot this week, landing Evans in fantasy WR1/WR2 range.","When your quarterback completes only 11 passes, it's not often a wide receiver will have a great day from a fantasy perspective. Thielen hauled in only three of his eight targets in Week 2 and suffered alongside the rest of the Minnesota offense. There are no guarantees that the Vikings offense will suddenly be better in Week 3, but the Titans did allow a healthy bit of passing from the Jaguars last week. If Jacksonville can do it, so can the Vikings. Consider Thielen as a WR2 for Week 3.","Joining Marshall Faulk, Edgerrin James, Dominic Rhodes, James Mungro, and Joseph Addai as the only rookies in franchise history with at least 25 carries, 100 yards and a score in a game, Taylor is now the unquestioned leader of the Colts' ground game. The Jets have surrendered the seventh-most fantasy points to backs this year, with Taylor primed for a big outing.","Last week, Prescott authored an amazing comeback against the Falcons where he threw for 450 yards and accounted for four scores -- including three rushing touchdowns. The 27-year-old signal-caller could be in line for another big day, facing a Seahawks defense that has given up the most yards through the air of any unit so far. Don't expect a repeat of the rushing heroics, but Prescott should absoltuely find paydirt through the air in Week 3.","The 49ers suffered quite a few injuries this weekend, and Mostert was among them. His injury isn't expected to be of the season-ending variety, but he's almost certainly out for Week 3. If he plays, lock him into your lineup as an RB2 against the Giants. Otherwise, look to Jerrick McKinnon as San Francisco's top back.","In his second career road game with at least 150 yards, Diggs connected with Josh Allen on a whopping five throws of at least 15 air yards. Thriving as the top option in a fun Buffalo passing game, Diggs next faces a challenging matchup with a solid Rams secondary. Given the awesome workload thus far with Josh Allen, Diggs is a solid WR2 candidate.","Shepard had to leave last week's game early due to turf toe and is questionable for this weekend, pending an MRI. Expect him to have to miss at least a week. If he's somehow able to go, the 49ers do boast a strong pass defense, likely to cause some issues for Daniel Jones. In or out for the Giants, Shepard should be a fantasy no-go for Week 3.","Busy as a security blanket for rookie passer Justin Herbert in Week 2, Henry is arguably the safest receiving threat on the team given his rapport with both of the team's quarterbacks. It also helps Henry's case that the Panthers struggle in coverage at safety.","Even without Michael Thomas in the lineup, Murray totaled only five touches in Monday night's affair. Barring an injury to Alvin Kamara, Murray is a fantasy non-entity.","It wasn't quite the \"vintage\" Aaron Rodgers performance we saw in Week 1 against Minnesota, but the Green Bay quarterback performed well in Week 2 and has avoided interceptions in both of his first two weeks of the 2020 season. The Saints have allowed plenty of production through the air over the first two weeks, so Rodgers makes for a solid, low-end play with some upside against New Orleans.","The Raiders had success both running and throwing the ball against the Saints on Monday night as Las Vegas christened Allegiant Stadium with a 34-24 victory. This week, New Orleans faces another balanced unit with Green Bay coming to the Big Easy. The Saints defense can generate turnovers, but they're also very likely to give those fantasy points back in yards and points allowed. With a full slate from which to choose, there are better units out there.",null,"A strong second half saw Robinson rumble for 85 of his 102 rushing yards, while also securing his first career rushing score. With a waning role on third downs in this one, Robinson is starting to look more like an early-down force than three-down threat, but it's still notable that this undrafted gem should handle at least 15 touches against an exploitable Dolphins defense."],"4":["Through three weeks, Kamara leads all running backs in yards from scrimmage (438), receptions (27) and touchdowns (6). Kamara usually does most of his damage running routes out of the backfield, but since the Lions have allowed the third-most RB rushing yards, he may enjoy a better game as a ball carrier. Nevertheless, at the end of Week 4, Kamara should keep his place as the top fantasy running back over the first quarter of the season.","No player in the NFL has more targets, receptions or yards than Hopkins, who will be a must-start every week this season as long as he's healthy . The touchdowns haven't been there yet, with only one in three games, but that will come around for the veteran wideout. Start him with confidence against Carolina.","It was a curious day for Evans as Tom Brady threw for 297 yards but only connected with Evans twice in Week 3, both for one-yard scores. While Evans' volume is likely to increase, in Week 4 he draws a tough Chargers secondary. Even so, Evans remains an automatic start, this week in the WR2 range.","Quite worryingly, Thielen has seen only 10 total targets over his past two games, hauling in only six of them for 60 yards. He does have a score over that span, but this is not the level of production we've come to expect from the Vikings' top receiver. Houston has allowed the 11th-fewest WR fantasy points this season, so it all adds up to a lackluster outing for Thielen in Week 4. That said, his track record suggests he'll bounce back sooner or later -- and he's too good not to start. ","Not yet truly a three-down force with Nyheim Hines still consuming a sizable share of snaps, Taylor is still impressively the lead early-down threat for the Colts. This role proves more valuable considering the Bears are allowing a generous 4.9 yards per carry to backs on the season, eighth most in the NFL. ","After three weeks, Prescott leads the league in passing yards, compiling 922 of them over the last two games. Next up is a date with a Cleveland defense that kept Dwayne Haskins Jr. in check last week, but gave up 591 total passing yards (with six combined touchdowns) to Kyler Murray and Joe Burrow to open the season. As such, Prescott remains one of the top options at the QB position for Week 4.","Mostert's health will be the deciding factor for his fantasy value in Week 4. If he's able to go against the Eagles, he's a must-start in fantasy given his great start to the season. Just keep an eye on the injury reports and have a backup plan ready.","If his quiet week for the Bills includes a touchdown and nearly 50 yards, then maybe the floor is really quite high for Diggs in Buffalo's thriving offense. Even as some regression hits this offense, Diggs remains a valuable fantasy option given such a rewarding rapport with Josh Allen. The Raiders have been solid against the pass, but Diggs' role is proving invaluable.",null,"Solid usage as Justin Herbert's security valve this past weekend saw Henry earn seven targets and a good bit of work between the numbers. The Buccaneers have allowed just 8.6 fantasy points per game to tight ends, but Henry's consistent target share helps offset the matchup issue.","If Murray doesn't score a touchdown, he isn't going to rack up enough production to be a fantasy consideration. So far in 2020, he's yet to reach the end zone. The Lions have only allowed two running touchdowns, but they have given up 146.3 RB yards per game, likely making Murray a bigger part of Sunday's game plan. Hopefully, you can find someone better, but this is the rare matchup to think about Murray as a flex in deep leagues.","Is the old Aaron Rodgers back? Not quite, but his performances this season have been more than startworthy from a fantasy perspective. With nine passing touchdowns in three games, he'll carry plenty of momentum into a matchup with the Falcons, who have allowed the most points to opposing passers so far in 2020. Rodgers is a must-start for Week 4.","The Saints defense has given up the 12th-fewest yards but the fifth-most scoreboard points. They aren't especially adept at forcing turnovers or sacking the quarterback. After a promising opening week effort, they've fallen into fantasy mediocrity, not worth starting even against a mediocre Lions offense.",null,"A career day from scrimmage included two touchdowns in Week 3, as Robinson has emerged as the early waiver wire or late-round steal of the season.

is coming off an up-and-down 2019 campaign, but the 24-year-old remains the main man in the New Orleans' backfield. Kamara missed a pair of games but otherwise played a similar role to 2018, handling 12.2 carries and 7.0 targets per game. Kamara ended the season with a YPC above 4.5 and exactly 81 catches for the third consecutive season. A lack of usage near the goal line (7.1 OTD, 6 TDs) limited his fantasy production, though he did finish strongly with four of those scores coming during Weeks 16-17. Kamara should have little trouble pushing for 20 touches per game in the Saints' Drew Brees-led, high-scoring offense. He remains a solid RB1.","Hopkins was traded to the Cardinals during the offseason and will now operate as Kyler Murray's go-to target. A top-five fantasy WR in four of the past five seasons, Hopkins has averaged 10.5 targets per game during that span, which is a mark he should still be able to approach with Arizona. Murray is far from a finished product, but the Cardinals' offense finished 2019 strong with three-plus touchdowns in eight of their final 11 games -- and that was without one of the game's best receivers. At age 28, Hopkins remains an elite fantasy option and should be selected near the first/second-round turn.","Evans returns as Tampa Bay's top perimeter wide receiver. However, for the first time since his rookie season in 2014, Jameis Winston won't be his primary quarterback. That may not seem ideal after Evans put together four consecutive seasons as a top-17 fantasy WR, but it's very possible that the 26-year-old's efficiency and consistency will actually improve with Tom Brady in town. Evans has ranked near the top of the league in aDOT and YPR throughout his career, but near the basement in both catch rate and RAC. That has led to inconsistent production, including 2019, when 53% of his fantasy point total for the season came during just three games. Even if the big plays are down a bit, Evans will see enough volume and goal-line work (he's never finished lower than ninth in end-zone targets) to reach his third top-10 fantasy campaign.","Following the offseason trade of Stefon Diggs to Buffalo, Thielen enters 2020 as the Vikings' clear-cut top target. Thielen missed six games because of injury last season, but was previously extremely reliable, having not missed a single game during his first five seasons. A top-10 fantasy WR in both 2017 and 2018, Thielen sat ninth prior to his Week 7 injury in 2019. Thielen turns 30 this year and Minnesota's run-heavy offense will limit his ceiling, but he's a safe bet for a generous target share and thus, a high fantasy floor. Grab him as your WR2.","The Colts surprisingly nabbed Taylor with the 41st pick of April's draft. An outstanding prospect purely from a rushing standpoint, the Wisconsin product paced this year's rookie class in carries, rushing yards and rushing touchdowns and ranked fourth with a 3.7 YAC in 2019. Taylor also crushed it at February's combine, running a position-best 4.39 40 and a solid 7.01 three cone despite a hefty 5-foot-10, 226-pound frame. The main concerns here are fumbles (18) and pass-catching ability (nine drops on 68 targets). Taylor has RB1 upside down the road, but his short-term fantasy value will suffer with incumbent early-down back Marlon Mack and passing-down specialist Nyheim Hines in the fold. Taylor is worth grabbing in the middle rounds, but it might take some time before he's a reliable fantasy starter.","Prescott will be back under center for Dallas following his best professional season in 2019. Prescott ranked no lower than sixth among quarterbacks in pass attempts (596), completions (388), passing yardage (4,902), passing touchdowns (30), yards per pass attempt (8.2) and average depth of throw (9.4) -- all while dealing with a league-high 30 drops. Also a factor as a rusher (52-277-3), Prescott finished a career-best second at the position in fantasy points. Armed with a terrific line, as well as WRs Amari Cooper, Michael Gallup and CeeDee Lamb, Prescott should be considered a solid QB1 option.","It's not often you see a running back break out in his fifth NFL campaign, but Mostert did exactly that down the stretch last season. Primarily a special-teams player throughout his career, Mostert put up 859 yards and scored 13 touchdowns on 133 touches during the 49ers' final nine games of 2019 (including the playoffs). An extremely efficient runner, Mostert is averaging 6.0 YPC on 178 regular-season carries for his career, which is easily best among 188 RBs with 150-plus carries. The concerns here are that Mostert plays a minimal pass-catching role (22 targets last season) and Kyle Shanahan is very unpredictable with his backfield rotation. As such, Mostert is best viewed as a flex with RB2 upside.","Diggs was traded to Buffalo during the offseason and will now operate as the Bills' top target. The 26-year-old posted a trio of top-25 fantasy campaigns during his final three seasons in Minnesota, but now moves to a low-volume, run-first Buffalo offense led by the inefficient and scramble-heavy Josh Allen. That figures to lead to a decrease in production for Diggs, which is a concern considering he was only the WR24 last season -- despite Kirk Cousins' extremely efficient campaign and with Adam Thielen sidelined. Diggs, who has never appeared in all 16 games of a regular season, is likely to be over-drafted and is best viewed as only a WR3.","Shepard has been a tricky player to figure out so far. The 2016 second-round pick has finished two seasons among the top-eight WRs in routes run, but he's also missed five-plus games in two different seasons and he's yet to finish any season better than No. 30 in fantasy points. Shepard replaced Odell Beckham Jr. as the Giants' No. 1 WR last season -- and he was very busy, handling six-plus targets during all 10 appearances. Only five other players can say the same. Shepard's efficiency was poor, but the volume allowed him the 17th-most fantasy points during those 10 weeks. Shepard will have more competition with a healthier group around him this season, but he's still a legitimate candidate to lead the team in targets. Don't sleep on the 26-year-old when flex hunting.","Henry is back with the Chargers after the team applied the franchise tag during the offseason. The team's 2016 second-round pick has yet to play a full 16-game season, missing all of 2018 and a total of seven games the other three seasons. That includes four in 2019, though Henry was productive enough when active to produce his first top-10 fantasy campaign. Henry has finished top-10 in YPT in all three of his NFL seasons and has been a force near the goal line, with 17 touchdowns and 25 end zone targets in 41 games. Henry's durability woes and the departure of Philip Rivers are concerns, but the 25-year-old will still be a back-end TE1 option when active.","Murray is now 30 years old, but he remains in a good spot as Alvin Kamara's backup in a high-scoring Saints' offense. In his first season in New Orleans, Murray was held to 98 touches and the 49th-most fantasy points among backs during the 14 weeks Kamara was also active. However, with Kamara sidelined during Weeks 7 and 8, Murray stepped in and racked up 307 yards and four touchdowns on 60 touches. He was fantasy's top-scoring RB in that span. Murray lacks stand-alone value but is obviously an elite insurance option.","Once a perennial top-two fantasy QB, Rodgers has settled in as more of a mid-to-back-end QB1 in recent seasons. That included 2019, which saw him finish ninth in fantasy points even though he appeared in all 16 games and ranked eighth in pass attempts. Rodgers' efficiency has been a culprit, as he hasn't finished better than 16th in YPA since 2014 after previously dominating the category. He also hasn't cleared 26 pass TDs in a season since 2016 and is no longer much of a factor with his legs. Rodgers has Davante Adams, Aaron Jones and a solid line at his disposal, but the 36-year-old is no longer an elite fantasy weapon.","The Saints' D/ST finished eighth in fantasy points last season and has now produced a pair of top-10 campaigns over the past three seasons. New Orleans has finished top five in sacks each of the past two seasons and came in average or better in interceptions, forced turnovers, yardage allowed and points allowed during both campaigns. The team's offseason departures (Vonn Bell, Eli Apple and A.J. Klein) all have replacements (Malcolm Jenkins, Janoris Jenkins and Alex Anzalone, respectively), and literally every other defender who played at least 32 snaps last season remains on the roster.

The good news is that he added 50 receptions and three receiving scores -- and that's where his value truly lies. Much like Alvin Kamara and similar do-it-all backs, Sanders is going to build up a solid base of points each week with receptions and yards, occasionally finding his way into the end zone. Plenty of upside remains for more scoring and a truly great season. That starts with what should be an RB1 performance in Week 1 against Washington.","Godwin and teammate Mike Evans are both poised for big seasons with Tom Brady at the helm of the Tampa Bay offense. The fourth-year pro out of Penn State broke out last season and established himself as one of the best in the league. He'll start Week 1 as a top target for Brady in what should be an exciting offense to watch. Start him in all formats.","Ridley has provided a solid secondary option to Julio Jones in his first two seasons with Atlanta, but could a breakout be on the way? It's hard to say, as Todd Gurley II should help keep pressure off of the passing game, but Matt Ryan is only getting older and Julio Jones is still as good as ever across from Ridley. That said, you'll take his contributions even if there is no breakout, and he's a solid WR3/flex in Week 1 against a mediocre Seattle pass defense.","A chronic knee ailment limited Gurley in 2019, but he still managed to find the end zone 12 times. Now a member of the Falcons, he'll likely see his workload managed. Still, he's the best back on the Atlanta roster and figures to get any fantasy-friendly touches in the red zone. Seattle allowed the 13th-most RB points a year ago, making Gurley a solid RB2 for his Atlanta debut.","A freshly signed extension should keep Allen with the Chargers for a long time. The target magnet could prove especially busy in Week 1 against a patchwork Bengals secondary with Mike Williams ailing. Expected to earn a huge share of the team's passing offense, Allen enters the season as a high-floor fantasy threat.","Jones has plenty of talent sitting behind him on the RB depth chart but, heading into Week 1, he seems to be the lead back for the Buccaneers. Tom Brady has always been able to bolster his backs with good receiving stats, and Jones is a capable pass-catcher, so he's a name to watch among backs who might not have been taken too early in your draft. The Saints had one of the 10 best defenses against running backs last year from a fantasy perspective, but Jones is still worthy of a flex spot in your Week 1 lineups.","A gifted vertical playmaker who has struggled to stay on the field in his career, the huge batch of targets left by DeAndre Hopkins could spell a breakout season from Fuller. The Chiefs were solid against receivers last season, but like a prime DeSean Jackson, it only takes one or two big plays for Fuller to produce a big fantasy line.","Contending with a compelling rookie talent for early-down usage could eventually limit Ingram's presence as a safe fantasy option, but to start the season, it appears the proven veteran will command a valuable majority of rushing opportunities. Having posted a healthy 6.3 yards per tote last season against a poor Cleveland rush defense, Ingram is poised for a solid opener.","Some dazzling collegiate yards-after-the-catch and elusiveness in addition to positive buzz from this preseason have Moss entering the season with some helium as a fantasy prospect. The Bills are projected to deploy a nearly even share for work between Moss and Devin Singletary, making it tough to trust this rookie in lineups against a Jets front that was stout against the run last season.","A fantasy force at his best in Carolina, injuries have cut short his past two seasons. In a new offense and years removed from being regularly productive, there is certainly some risk in streaming Newton in lineups to open the season. Working in his favor is the fact the Dolphins allowed 21.4 fantasy points per game to signal-callers last season and struggled to contain rushing quarterbacks. If Newton is still a dominant rushing presence, this could be a fun debut.","The loss of awesome playmaker Derwin James is a big blow to this defense, but a pair of elite edge rushers and a deep secondary helps Los Angeles enter Week 1 as a worthy streaming option. The Bengals have an exciting young team led by Joe Burrow, but there is also some real fantasy potential in facing a rookie making his first start.","Howard isn't likely to disappear just because Rob Gronkowski has arrived in Tampa Bay, but his upside is drastically diminished. A healthy Gronk means Howard should be on the bench in your fantasy league, but we've seen Tom Brady involve multiple tight ends before. Keep an eye on the Alabama product.","Fournette should immeditely find a role with the Buccaneers as a brusier back splitting time with Ronald Jones II. However, much like the Tom Brady offenses of old in New England, it's going to be tough to know which back will be worth a fantasy start in any given week. Fournette seems like the weakest link in the passing game on the Tampa Bay RB depth chart, though, which is a good reason to keep him sidelined in fantasy for Week 1.",null,"Last season, the Cardinals had one of the worst fantasy D/ST units, and scored zero fantasy points over two matchups with the 49ers. Avoid them in Week 1 against their divisional rivals."],"2":["Sanders was unable to go in Week 1 as a hamstring injury kept him on the sidelines. Thereâ€™s a strong chance heâ€™ll be ready for a good Week 2 matchup against a Rams defense susceptible to the run. Keep an eye on the injury reports. If Sanders is practicing in full, heâ€™ll be a high-end RB2 this week.","Tom Bradyâ€™s favorite receiver is usually the guy thatâ€™s open. That said, Week 1 did reveal that Tampa Bay's new quarterback trusts Godwin, as he had a team-leading seven targets, resulting in six catches for 79 yards. Of course, Mike Evans was hobbled most of the contest. Godwin will always be \"second fiddle\" to Evans, but that can also benefit his stats when a healthy Evans draws the opposing secondary's top cover man. With or without a healthy Evans, Godwin is a solid fantasy WR1 in Week 2 as Tampa Bay hosts Carolina's porous defense.","Ridley picked up where he left off last season as he was a top-five wide receiver from Weeks 11-14 before missing the rest of the year. He will be hard-pressed to match his opening week's nine catches for 130 yards and two scores, but so long as Julio Jones is drawing primary coverage, volume will be ample to keep Ridley firmly in the WR2 range. This week is no exception as Matt Ryan is likely going to be forced to keep pace with the Cowboys' prolific offense.","One of the reasons Atlanta signed Gurley was his prowess at finding the end zone. He paid dividends right away, scoring early, before the Falcons fell behind. That limited his second-half usage. Gurley will again be the early-down and goal-line back facing a Cowboys defense without LB Leighton Vander Esch, who fractured his collarbone in Week 1. Gurley's yardage production could again be limited by game flow, but he still ranks as an RB2 due to his proclivity for scoring touchdowns.","A forgettable first outing left Allen with just 37 total yards thanks to a modest 68 air yards in the game. The Chiefs don't claim top coverage talents at cornerback, so the hope is that a rewarding rapport between Tyrod Taylor and the newly-paid Allen will surface.","Even after Leonard Fournette was brought on board, Jones was still listed as the Buccaneers' No. 1 running back -- and the snap distribution seemed to confirm that as Jones led the backfield with 32 plays in the huddle. With 17 carries and two catches, Jones touched the ball more than 50% of the time he was on the field. Fournette may eventually eat into Jonesâ€™ playing time, but that's no guarantee. Facing a defense that allowed 139 total yards to Josh Jacobs last week renders Jones as a solid RB2/flex option for Week 2.","Living up to the hype in his supercharged role as the team's vertical playmaker, Fuller not only lead the Texans with 14.1 air yards per target in Week 1, he produced 73 more yards than any of his teammates in the loss. With the potential to be Deshaun Watson's top target going into this difficult matchup with the Ravens, Fuller is a solid flex option.","Without any real role in the passing phase, Ingram's role was limited to early downs in Week 1. Worse yet, rookie J.K. Dobbins consumed and converted valuable goal-line touches, leaving Ingram with a quiet line. This is simply a one-game sample, but a lack of receiving and goal-line equity going forward wouldn't be ideal for Ingram's fantasy stock. This said, he's still expected to be the team's backfield leader and is in the flex tier for this week's tilt against a Houston front that struggled to contain the Kansas City backfield last week.","At just 2.3 yards per touch in his first game, Moss wasn't efficient, yet his performance was promising thanks to converting a goal-line touch into a score in his debut. Moss could repeat his workload from last week of a dozen touches, which clearly outlines some risk. Then again, at least the opponent is inviting and his potential for a touchdown elevates given his success in high-leverage work in Week 1.","All Newton did in his first start with the Patriots was produce more carries, yards, yards after contact, and touchdowns than any of his teammates. His 15 totes mark the most even by a Patriots quarterback in a game and the most rushing yardage since Steve Grogan in 1977. Which is to say, Cam was Cam. The Seahawks don't have a shutdown defense at this stage, while Newton's fantasy floor is now quite high given such a vintage rushing performance.","Joey Bosa is a boss and this team's deep secondary somehow appears poised to prove dangerous without Derwin James. This all said, it's nearly impossible to trust any defense facing Patrick Mahomes and his deep and dangerous crew of skill players.","Despite playing on a limited 37 snaps, Howard lead the talented Tampa Bay TE corps with four receptions on six targets, scoring once. It remains to be seen how the workload ultimately sorts itself out, but with Rob Gronkowski getting more acclimated every week, Howard may have already had his best performance of the season. Barring an injury to Gronkowski, Howard remains unrosterable.","Fournette was on the field for only nine plays, carrying the ball five times for just five yards while securing his only target for 14 yards. His role could grow as he becomes more familiar with Bruce Ariansâ€™ system. As it currently stands, though, let someone else roster the name brand.",null,"Washington may have won in Week 1, but that victory wasn't based on a particularly strong offensive performance (239 total yards). It might be tempting to add the Cardinals to your fantasy lineup as a result of their prime matchup, but remember that this is a unit which has struggled to generate turnovers and sacks -- crucial elements in the fantasy point formula for D/STs. With three sacks and no takeaways in Week 1, it doesn't seem like the Cardinals are quite ready to be a starting D/ST in 2020."],"3":["After sitting out Week 1 with a sore hamstring, Sanders began his sophomore campaign with a strong effort, gaining 95 yards on 20 carries, including a touchdown -- plus three catches for 36 yards. Week 3 could be even more productive as the Eagles face a Bengals defense that has been carved up for 358 yards on the ground so far, the most in the league through two weeks. Sanders has top-five RB upside this week.","Good news for those with Godwin on their roster as he's set to return to action, having cleared the league's concussion protocol. While he had to miss last week's date with the Panthers, this is a good week for Godwin to come back. The Broncos defense has allowed a hefty 560 yards and four touchdowns to wideouts in the first two games of the season. As such, the fourth-year wideout regains his customary high-end WR2 status.","Not only has Ridley been the Falcons' top wideout, he's the No. 1 overall fantasy receiver so far in 2020. The Falcons' proclivity for throwing the ball will keep Ridley's output high, but expect a dip facing a tough Bears defense in what should be a lower-scoring game than Atlanta's first two affairs. Even a healthy Julio Jones won't keep Ridley from borderline WR1 status.","Even with Atlanta's pass-happy attack over the first two weeks, Gurley has only been targeted five times -- and all in the first game. He's still getting running volume and is the primary goal-line option, but this week will face a Chicago team that's allowed only three total touchdowns over the first two weeks. Gurley's workload keeps him as an RB2, but his upside is limited unless Atlanta starts using him more as a receiver out of the backfield.","A strong, volume-driven showing in Week 2 might prove to be an outlier if the offense reverts to the conservative approach of Tyrod Taylor. Then again, Allen is so consistently open that he can work well with either arm, especially against a subpar secondary such as Carolina's.","Week 2 looked to be favorable for Jones and he came through early with a first-quarter touchdown. However, as the game progressed, it was Leonard Fournette who received the bulk of the playing time. With both backs healthy, Bruce Arians is probably going to ride the hot hand -- with Fournette looking like he may overtake Jones on the depth chart. The reduced workload drops Jones to no more than a Week 3 fantasy flex in deep formats.","Apparently dealing with a hamstring injury throughout the game, Fuller didn't see a single target on his 22 routes in Week 2. After a breakout Week 1, this was quite the crash for Fuller. The Steelers are up next and have actually been somewhat generous to receivers, helping Fuller's case if he's good to go this week.","An awesome trick play saw Ingram deliver a touchdown to help boost an otherwise mediocre output in Week 2. It's become clear the Ravens will apply a committee approach from the backfield. That said, Ingram is still the name to trust from this backfield given goal-line duties and his ability to break a big play. It also helps that the Chiefs have allowed nearly 27 fantasy points per game to backs this year.","Moss tallied 37 scrimmage yards in Week 2. It appears unlikely the rookie will help much in the receiving phase, meaning he'll need to do damage around the goal line to factor in fantasy. The Rams present a solid matchup for backs, but Moss just isn't in a good enough role to trust in lineups.","Fresh from his 40th career game with both passing and rushing scores, extending his own NFL record, Newton now has five career games with at least 40 passing attempts and 10 rushing attempts; no other QB since the merger has more than two such outings. Back to being a productive rushing threat, Newton is a strong fantasy play against the Raiders this week.","A respectable effort against the Chiefs revealed how deep and talented this Chargers defense proves. Now facing a Carolina offense without much firepower, this D/ST claims real potential to provide rewarding results.","With Leonard Fournette doing most of the damage in a ball-control game, and Mike Evans handling the bulk of the receiving work when needed, there wasn't much left for Howard. He saw just three looks in Week 2, resulting in only one reception for 11 yards. Depending on your free-agent and waiver rules, it may not be worth carrying two tight ends. Howard can easily be a drop option if you're looking to free up roster space.","Game script favored Fournette last week and he took advantage by eclipsing the century mark on the ground in his second game with Tampa Bay. He finished with 103 yards and two rushing touchdowns, along with four receptions for another 13 yards. Ronald Jones is still listed ahead of Fournette on the Buccaneers' RB depth chart, but it's looking more like a time share. Fournette projects as a RB2/flex against a tough Denver run defense.",null,"The Cardinals have looked great to start the season, including on defense, where they've allowed only 35 scoreboard points through two contests. They've yet to intercept a pass, but did force two turnovers against Washington and have seven total sacks this year. Detroit has been struggling out of the gate and, while this is all based on small samples, it might just be worth giving one of 2019's worst D/STs a shot in Week 3, given their recent history and a matchup at home against the Lions."],"4":["After missing the first week of the season, Sanders has since come through with 95 yards rushing in both of the last two weeks. He also has seen 15 targets, a number boosted by a depleted Eagles WR corps. Sanders should continue to see a heavy workload and could do some damage against a 49ers front that has endured several injuries. Sanders again registers as a low-end RB1.","Godwin was enjoying a solid game last week, catching five passes for 64 yards and a score before leaving with a hamstring injury. Unfortunately, Godwin is likely to be out this week and maybe more.","Ridley only caught 5-of-13 targets, but it was good for his third straight 100-yard game, even as he failed to score for the first time this season. Next up, Ridley lines up against a leaky Packers secondary that has given up seven touchdowns to wideouts. With or without Julio Jones active, Ridley is a solid fantasy WR1.","Gurley tallied a workmanlike 80 yards on 14 carries -- including a 10-yard touchdown -- but remains a nonentity in the passing game. That could change this week as the Packers have surrendered the third-most backfield receiving yards along with a healthy 4.9 YPC. Gurley's volume and his nose for the end zone render him as a solid RB2.","Eighteen targets is almost certain to deliver special results, with Allen's 13-catch Week 3 opus as evidence. If Justin Herbert remains behind center, this heavy concentration of targets to Allen could continue. The Buccaneers are allowing the 10th fewest yards to receivers, while Allen's rich target share helps offset such matchup woes. ","After playing second-fiddle in Week 2, Jones outpaced Leonard Fournette in Week 3's encounter with the Broncos. The two backs should continue to be in a time-share, though the majority holder in any given week will be a mystery. Unless he establishes clear dominance, Jones is nothing more than a deep flex play.","It was encouraging for his fantasy profile that Fuller led the team in routes and targets in a nice bounce-back showing after Week 2's no-show.  A strong average depth of target helps Fuller's potential for big plays against a Vikings secondary allowing nearly 47 fantasy points per game to receivers. ","A sizable downturn in snaps and touches versus last season has Ingram reliant on touchdowns to surface with any real fantasy value. No longer due for many touches, Ingram will need to prove very efficient to deliver fantasy value this week against an improved Washington defense. ","A toe injury kept Moss from the field in Week 3, so we'll want to see how the rookie handles practice this week. If he's good to go, Moss becomes a deep sleeper in that he could thrive against a leaky Raiders defense allowing the most fantasy points to backfields by a wide margin.","Las Vegas limited Newton to just 189 total yards (162 passing, 27 rushing), his fewest in a game this season. Fifteen of Newton's 17 completions traveled five-or-fewer yards in the air, marking the second-lowest average depth of target in a game in his career. Things will need to open up for Newton as he faces a high-scoring Chiefs team. Given what should be a demanding workload, Newton is a solid QB1 candidate.","Down to 19th in pressure rate and now with Melvin Ingram on injured reserve, the Chargers aren't in a great spot to defend a Tampa Bay offense that enters the week with some real momentum. Even with Joey Bosa and some talented corners, the absence of multiple playmakers from this D/ST has changed expectations. ","Howard will remain a weekly contributor to the Tampa Bay offense, but with Rob Gronkowski getting reacclimated to his long-time QB friend, Howard's numbers aren't likely to get better than Week 3's line of three receptions for 49 yards. That's not what you want from your fantasy tight end.","In Week 3, Fournette logged just one fewer snap than in Week 2. Unfortunately, he received just seven carries in the contest. It will take a crystal ball to discern how Bruce Arians will split the workload between Fournette and Ronald Jones in Week 4. If you're in the mood to roll the dice, Fournette can check in as a flex option against a stingy Chargers defense.",null,"After finishing last season at the bottom of the rankings, the Cardinals D/ST has exceeded expectations through three weeks. While they have yet to face a very difficult offensive matchup, that doesn't change in Week 4 against Carolina, a unit that ranks near the middle of the pack in yards (16th), points (9th) and turnovers (16th).

took a while for him to get rolling, but Sanders certainly took command of lead-back duties in Philadelphia during the second half of his rookie season. Sanders put down a solid 179-818-3 rushing line, but where he truly stood out was as a receiver. Sanders' 50-509-3 line was fueled by 8.2 yards per target, which was second best at the position. Sanders didn't play more than 53% of the snaps in a game until Week 11, but he finished 15th among backs in fantasy points. The 23-year-old is primed for a larger share of the workload behind the Eagles' elite offensive line in 2020.

Inexplicably a situational player under Dirk Koetter, Godwin finished 2019 ranked as a top-10 WR in snaps, routes, yardage and touchdowns. He finished fourth at the position in catch rate (72%) and RAC (6.6) and was first in first-down rate (50%). Godwin is a candidate for touchdown regression (9 TD, 5.1 OTD) in 2020 and will have a new quarterback in Tom Brady, but the 24-year-old appears to be the real deal. Consider him as a solid WR1.","Ridley enters his third NFL season as Atlanta's No. 2 wide receiver behind Julio Jones. The 2018 first-round pick impressed during his first two campaigns, catching 69% of his passes and averaging a healthy 8.0 YPT. Ridley took a step forward last season and actually had one of the highest floors in fantasy, finishing 27th or better during nine of his 13 outings. He sat 14th at the position in fantasy points prior to Week 14's season-ending abdomen injury. Especially with Mohamed Sanu and Austin Hooper gone, Ridley's role as Matt Ryan's No. 2 target is safe. The 25-year-old is a fringe top-20 fantasy receiver.","Gurley is now the lead back in Atlanta following five seasons with the Rams. The Georgia product was a top-three fantasy RB in both 2017 and 2018, but he handled a lesser workload and struggled badly with efficiency in 2019 while dealing with knee and ankle concerns. After averaging 4.89 YPC (2.11 YAC) on 256 carries and 7.4 yards per target on 78 targets in 14 games in 2018, Gurley's numbers plummeted to 3.84 YPC (1.81 YAC) on 223 carries and 4.2 YPT on 49 targets in 15 games last season. Gurley still managed a 14th-place finish in fantasy points (his fifth top-15 in as many tries), thanks to 14 touchdowns. Gurley's durability is a big concern, but he has little competition for touches in a good offense. He's a fine RB2 target.","Allen enters his eighth NFL season in unfamiliar territory. The 2013 third-round pick has been targeted 758 times in his career -- and 751 of them have come from the hand of Philip Rivers. Rivers, who is now with the Colts, has helped Allen to top-13 finishes in targets, receptions, receiving yards and fantasy points in each of the past three seasons. Even with Rivers, Allen is coming off a very boom/bust fantasy campaign in which he was a top-20 WR in half of his outings, but outside the top 30 during the other half. Allen is still in his prime at age 28 and hasn't missed a game since 2016, but he hasn't scored more than six TDs in any season since 2013. The uncertainty of the Chargers' quarterback situation is a red flag, so Allen is best viewed as a WR2.","Following what was a disastrous rookie season in 2018, Jones added weight and got his career back on track with an impressive showing in 2019. After totaling 77 yards on 30 touches in 2018, Jones produced 1,003 yards and six touchdowns on 203 touches last season. Despite his second-round pedigree and superior play relative to his counterparts in the Tampa Bay backfield, Jones was limited to only 37% of the snaps and 47% of the designed runs. It's very possible we've yet to see the best of Jones, as he was drafted very young and is entering his age-23 season. However, following the offseason additions of Leonard Fournette, LeSean McCoy and Ke'Shawn Vaughn, Jones is not an appealing flex options. He should be on benches unless he earns clear lead duties.","The Texans traded away DeAndre Hopkins during the offseason, which should vault 2016 first-round pick Fuller to a full-on fantasy breakout. The problem, of course, is that Fuller is entering his fifth NFL season having already missed 34% of his team's games because of injury. That number includes five games last season. The good news is that, when healthy, Fuller has been heavily targeted and productive. In nine full games last season, he handled 7.7 targets per game (a 25% share) and trailed Hopkins by only nine total targets. He was fantasy's No. 13 WR in those weeks. It's hard to expect a full season from the oft-injured receiver, but Fuller undoubtedly still has massive upside. The 26-year-old is best viewed as a flex.","Volume is king in fantasy football, but Ingram did his best to be the exception to that rule during his first season as Baltimore's lead back. Despite handling only 37% of the team's carries and 7% of the targets, Ingram was fantasy's No. 11 scoring RB, thanks to the Ravens' high-scoring offense. Ingram ranked 22nd in touches and 15th in scrimmage yards, but his 15 touchdowns ranked fourth. An injury-plagued 2018 season aside, Ingram has been a top-15 fantasy RB each season since 2014. Despite the positivity, it will be hard to count on a repeat from Ingram in 2020. He's now 30, which means his volume is unlikely to rise (especially with J.K. Dobbins now in the mix), he plays a minimal role as a receiver and the Baltimore offense figures to regress in scoring. Ingram is a fringe RB2 with a low ceiling.","The Bills selected Moss with a third-round pick in April's draft. Moss is an elite prospect in two key areas: YAC (second-best in this year's rookie class in 2019) and forced missed tackles (second). The Utah product has terrific size (5-foot-9, 223 pounds) and the balance, toughness, quickness and receiving ability to emerge as one of the game's top backs, though speed is a major concern following his 4.65 40-yard dash at the combine. Moss joins Devin Singletary in the Bills' backfield. The two figure to limit each other's fantasy output, though the rookie has 20 pounds on his new teammate, which could vault him into a significant role on early downs and at the goal line. Moss could flirt with the flex radar and is a fine mid-round target.","Newton signed with the Patriots following nine seasons in Carolina. The dual-threat quarterback was playing some of the best ball of his career in 2018, but that campaign was cut short by a late-season shoulder injury and a foot injury derailed his 2019 campaign. Newton attempted only 89 passes and ran the ball five times in two games prior to being shut down for the season. Now that he's 31 years old, it's fair to wonder whether he can still be a factor with his legs and, if not, can he make up for it with his arm? Even missing two games in 2018, Newton finished  top five at the position in carries, rushing yards and rushing touchdowns for the eighth consecutive season, so it's very possible he has something left in the tank. He's worth a late-round flier, as he'll be back on the QB1 radar if he beats out Jarrett Stidham.","The Chargers fell well short of lofty expectations in 2019, and that also applies to the team's D/ST. The unit fell to 21st in fantasy points following three consecutive top-12 campaigns. Los Angeles still showed well in terms of yards (sixth) and points (12th) allowed, but forced a league-low 14 turnovers and managed only 30 sacks (28th). Thomas Davis and Adrian Phillips were the team's only significant offseason losses, with the overall defense upgraded following the addition of Linval Joseph, Chris Harris Jr. and first-round-pick Kenneth Murray to a group that also includes Joey Bosa, Melvin Ingram, Derwin James, Casey Hayward and Desmond King (who has returned one punt for a touchdown each of the past two seasons). This is a fringe starting D/ST.","Howard had the look of a lock for a breakout 2019 season, but Bruce Arians' tight end-unfriendly offense limited the 2017 first-round pick to a 34-459-1 receiving line in 14 games. Howard has now finished top-three in aDOT and top-four in YPR during each of his three NFL seasons, but 10 missed games due to injury have limited his fantasy output. Perhaps Tom Brady can lead Howard to a fourth-year explosion, but it's an extreme longshot with Rob Gronkowski now atop the depth chart (not to mention Cameron Brate also in the mix). Expect Howard to work as a part-time player and blocking specialist. The 25-year-old should only be on rosters in dynasty leagues.","Fournette signed with Tampa Bay after being cut by the Jaguars. At least from a fantasy perspective, Fournette finally lived up to his first-round pedigree during a breakout 2019 season and emerged as one of the league's rare workhorse running backs. During 15 active weeks, Fournette played 88% of the snaps, handling 87% of the carries and 19% of the targets. Fournette finished no lower than seventh among backs in carries, targets, receptions, touches, yards and fantasy points. Fournette's season would've been even more impressive had it not been for some atrocious touchdown luck. Despite a healthy 9.3 OTD (10th highest), Fournette scored three touchdowns. He may lead Tampa Bay in touches this season, but he won't be a workhorse with Ronald Jones and LeSean McCoy (among others) in the mix.

The Bengals are a friendly first matchup for Ekeler to exploit, as Cincinnati yielded a generous 28 fantasy points per game to backs in PPR formats in 2019.","Second among backs in scrimmage yardage last season, Chubb seems to have lost some luster as a fantasy prospect with the presence of third-down threat Kareem Hunt in the backfield mix. Even if he's isolated to early downs, Chubb remains a must-start option facing a Ravens defense that allowed him to rumble for 183 total yards in a September matchup last season.","A breakout second professional season signals Sutton can handle the responsibility of being Denver's top target in the passing phase. There is arguably more competition for meaningful targets after an offseason loading up on skill players in Denver, but it's still quite clear that Sutton will command a strong share of opportunities. The Titans allowed the 12th-most yards to receivers last season, aiding Sutton's case as a solid fantasy starter.","Higbee finished the season strong in 2019, going for 100-plus yards in four of his final five contests and seeing his target total skyrocket over that span. However, that was with Gerald Everett on the sideline -- a complicating factor that will make the early stages of the 2020 season important in terms of figuring out the fantasy value of both Rams tight ends. By all accounts, Higbee should be one of the team's top passing-game options and a starting fantasy tight end, but keep a careful eye on his usage and playing time in the early games. With all that in mind, the Cowboys were one of the worst teams against tight ends in 2019, making this an excellent spot to roll out Higbee as a fantasy starter.","Ryan has been a regular roller coaster in terms of performance, averaging 25-plus points per game in 2016 and 2018 but only 19 in 2017 and 23 in 2019. Those high marks are still more than good enough for fantasy purposes, but consistency is not among his strengths these days. The Seahawks had a below-average pass defense a year ago, so Atlanta's quarterback should be considered a low-end QB1 for Week 1 of 2020.","A quietly stellar 2019 for Landry saw him establish a new yardage peak thanks to newfound success on vertical opportunities. With 15 hauls for 241 yards against Baltimore in two meetings last season, Landry's success from the slot bodes well for his potential as a flex option in Week 1.","In his NFL debut last season, Hockenson arrived with a flourish, going for 131 yards and a touchdown. However, that was against the Cardinals -- a team notorious for its struggles at defending tight ends -- and he couldn't find that magic again for the rest of the year. He suffered a late-season ankle injury and might not be back to full strength yet, so it's probably wise to take a patient approach with the second-year pro. Leave him out of your Week 1 lineups.","Johnson was very impressive during his first NFL season, averaging over 5.0 YPC in limited work. Things balanced out a bit in Year 2, as that number dropped to 3.6. The reality for 2020 is likely to be somewhere in between, but unfortunately his biggest issue this season might be opportunity. Rookie D'Andre Swift and veteran Adrian Peterson are both poised to cut into Johnson's workload, so he's a risky flex option (at best) against the Bears in Week 1.","Sanders has taken a step back from the high-volume, reliable WR numbers he provided the Broncos in his first three seasons with the team beginning in 2014, but he's also been on some struggling offenses over that time. Linking up with Drew Brees ought to help him get back on track, but to what extent remains to be seen. He could prove to be a solid weekly contributor or we might find that with so many touches going to Michael Thomas and Alvin Kamara, his point totals rise and fall. He should be considered as no more than a flex flier option for Week 1 against a porous Tampa Bay pass defense.",null,"The return of Bradley Chubb to the edge of Denver's defense could prove pivotal to this group's fantasy potential. The Titans yielded the ninth-highest pressure rate in the pocket, aiding this D/ST's potential as a streaming option in Week 1.","The addition of Robby Anderson to the Carolina offense certainly doesn't help Samuel, who has struggled to find a consistent role in this offense since his arrival after the 2017 Draft. He had his best season in 2018, but it wasn't quite good enough (just under 11 points per game) to merit a weekly spot in fantasy lineups. The battle for looks in the Panthers' passing game might not swing in Samuel's favor, so he's a risky flex play for Week 1.","Denver is handing over the offense to this second-year signal-caller. The team invested heavily over the offseason in acquiring receiving and rushing talent to help make Lock's life a bit easier behind center. Relying on a young pocket quarterback in a run-heavy offense to produce strong fantasy numbers against a solid Tennessee defense isn't a great strategy to open the season.","A magical 2018 working with Andrew Luck might just be an outlier in an otherwise mediocre career for Ebron. Then again, the ceiling is fairly high given Ebron is back to working with an established quarterback and should run ahead of Vance McDonald in regards to snaps, routes, and targets. We still don't know just how the split with McDonald will play out, thus it's best to prove patient with Ebron heading into this initial matchup with a Giants defense that was actually solid against tight ends last year.","Big plays in pass defense helped this defense compile 16 picks en route to a top-12 fantasy finish. Relying on such playmaking isn't ideal when it comes to investing in fantasy defenses, thus this first matchup against a talented Houston offense leaves the Chiefs' D/ST as a fringe streaming option."],"2":["The positive spin from Week 1 includes Ekeler earning 20 touches in a victory Austin Ekeler had 50 total snaps at running back â€” that was more than any Chargers back had in any game in 2019. A more concerned lens sees that Ekeler was targeted just once in the game and ceded valuable goal-line work to rookie Joshua Kelley. Ekeler still lined up plenty in the slot and was on the field enough to suggest he'll eventually earn more inclusion in the passing game. A telling test for an uptick in passing opportunities comes this week against a Chiefs front seven that can struggle in coverage.","Sure, game script while trailing big to Baltimore was likely going to favor Kareem Hunt's profile, but it's admittedly disconcerting that Hunt handled more first-down rushes than Chubb en route six more touches. With nearly even usage expected in a more neutral game plan, such as the one expected in Week 2 with the Bengals, Chubb enters the week as an RB2 candidate. ","Inactive with a shoulder injury this past week, Sutton appeared close to suiting up, making his season debut possible this week against the Steelers. If there were an exploitable element in the Steelers' defense it's at outside corner, with Sutton poised as a flex or WR2 option if active.","Higbee was the clear leader in playing time and opportunities among Los Angeles tight ends in Week 1, but Gerald Everett did leave the game with a back injury, so it remains to be seen exactly how these two will work together moving forward. For now, Higbee seems to be the better fantasy option of the two, given his superior role (four targets in Week 1 after finishing last season on a hot streak). He's a borderline starter at a position lacking in great options. ","Ryan led all quarterbacks with 450 yards in Week 1, although most of the damage was done from behind as the Falcons were playing catchup in Seattle for most of the game. Atlanta is on the road again, facing a Dallas defense which allowed 266 passing yards to the Rams in their opener. Ryan should be forced to throw a lot again, rendering him as a top-10 option and a decent QB1 for Week 2.","Last season's solid opportunity rates appear to have carried over, as Landry averaged a healthy 12 air yards per target in Week 1. The Bengals aren't stacked in the secondary, setting up Landry as a solid WR2 or flex candidate for this division matchup.","Another season, another strong Week 1 performance for Hockenson. The second-year pro hauled in all five of his targets -- including his lone look in the red zone -- to finish with 56 yards and a score. He saw extra looks with Kenny Golladay out, but he's also more established and comfortable in the Lions offense as a second-year pro, and could be on the verge of a breakout campaign. He's worth a shot as a low-end starter at his position in Week 2 against Green Bay, especially if Golladay remains out.","Of Detroit's top-three backs, Johnson played on the fewest snaps and saw the least total production in Week 1. That's a worrying sign -- and one that should signal to fantasy managers that Johnson belongs on the bench or waivers for now, at least until the RB depth chart clears up a bit for the Lions.","Though Sanders caught a red-zone touchdown in his New Orleans debut, Drew Brees targeted him just five times, resulting in three receptions for a paltry five yards. Sanders will usually play second fiddle to Michael Thomas, but with his teammate suffering a high-ankle sprain, Sanders' workload could increase against a suspect Las Vegas pass defense. If Thomas is good to go, Sanders is just a flex option. However, if Thomas is out, Sanders leaps up to the WR3 range.",null,"Missing Von Miller and his elite pressure rate, the Broncos struggled to create big plays against the Titans' passing game in Week 1. Now on the road against a capable veteran-led Pittsburgh passing game, Denver isn't a solid option at this matchup-driven position.","On a different team, Samuel could be a productive WR3 or even a WR2, but with DJ Moore and Christian McCaffrey in tow, the 24-year old wideout will likely continue to receive only around the six touches he garnered in Week 1. Samuel is fine as a reserve on deep rosters, but he isnâ€™t someone to count on as a starter.","A modest statistical showing in the opener doesn't offer much hope for Lock to rise to the challenge of playing an elite Pittsburgh defense in Week 2. Missing some key skill players to injury, Lock isn't a worthy option this week.","Preseason talk of Ebron being a dynamic playmaker saw him produce just one catch in his debut with the Steelers. Given the offense essentially ignored the tight end position in the passing phase, Ebron enters this meeting with the Broncos just outside of the starting tier of the position.","The Chargers' new-look offense trends run-heavy overall and conservative in the passing phase. Such an agenda can limit the fantasy fun for an opposing D/ST. One selling point is the Chiefs' elite offense and the value in playing from ahead as a defense. Predicting game script isn't always a solid science, thus Kansas City is more of a fringe play this week."],"3":["Fear of Ekeler losing valuable equity in the receiving phase was countered a bit by Week 2's strong dual-threat showing. It would help Ekeler's weekly floor if he can prove productive as a receiver with Tyrod Taylor this week, but he's back in the RB1 mix either way given the choice matchup and expectedly healthy workload.","A sluggish Week 1 gave way to a brilliant second outing that included pacing the team by 11 touches. Chubb gained 77 yards after contact on 22 rushes in the win over the Bengals and is poised for another strong showing against a capable, but still exploitable, Washington front seven.","A devastating knee injury ends Sutton's season early. ","Higbee had a week-winning fantasy performance against the Eagles, hauling in three touchdowns on five targets to score a ton of points for those who started him. He showed signs of this ability late last season and certainly remains a viable starting option given his playing time in 2020. Just don't expect three scores every week. He's a low-end TE1 against a Bills defense that was solid against tight ends a season ago, but hasn't gotten off to the best start in 2020.","Through two weeks, Ryan is second overall in both passing yards and TD passes, but he checks in as just the No. 6 overall fantasy quarterback since he doesn't run. In Week 3, Ryan faces a tough Bears defense that has only allowed one TD pass so far. Much of Ryan's production has come from behind and the Bears aren't as likely to exploit the Falcons' suspect defense as other teams, so Ryan's attempts and numbers could suffer. This should push him out of his usual QB1 status for Week 3.","Afforded only three targets in Week 2, Landry never really got a shot at producing. Things figure to be better in a softer matchup this week with a Washington secondary that struggles to contain slot weapons.","Hockenson actually leads the Lions in receiving yards through two games, catching all nine of his targets and finding the end zone, as well. The Cardinals have historically been very poor against tight ends and Hockenson appears to be firmly in the Lions' plans on offense, so we recommend him as a low-end starter in most leagues.","Johnson provided the touchdown and the biggest batch of red-zone touches among Detroit's backs in Week 2, but this three-man rotation is not good news for fantasy managers. Johnson, Adrian Peterson and D'Andre Swift are splitting playing time and opportunities, which leaves them all as poor options for Week 3, even against a porous Arizona defense.","For the second straight week, Sanders and Drew Brees failed to click as the wideout hauled in just 1-of-3 targets for 18 yards. Brees tried to get Sanders involved early, but the veteran receiver couldn't handle the pass. Wait for Sanders and Brees to get on the same page before rostering the 33-year-old journeyman receiver.",null,"Tom Brady and the Buccaneers left a few passing scores on the field last week and have actually looked better than the numbers might suggest. Denver, meanwhile, doesn't have a steady pass rush now with Von Miller sidelined, curbing any fantasy fun for this tough matchup against a capable Tampa Bay offense.","Samuel's 51 snaps in Week 2 were only 3 fewer than what Robby Anderson saw -- but that resulted in only six touches. That number could increase significantly with Samuel likely to receive more backfield work due to  Christian McCaffrey being sidelined. Even so, use Week 3 to track Samuel's usage and production. He's not worth investing with a roster spot just yet.",null,"A second week in the system saw Ebron notably earn 30 routes and a healthy 10 air yards per target. While the receiving totals don't show it just yet, there is some potential for a solid showing from Ebron facing a Houston defense allowing nearly a dozen fantasy points per game to tight ends.","An awesome marquee matchup on Monday evening pits Lamar Jackson and the incredible rushing success of the Ravens against the Chiefs' defense. The Chiefs don't rank as a top team in either creating pressure or turnovers, thus it's best to avoid this D/ST in such a challenging matchup."],"4":["An absolute fantasy force in Week 3 thanks to securing all 11 of his targets in addition to delivering a touchdown, the team's shift behind center has worked in Ekeler's favor from a usage standpoint. The Buccaneers have proven stingy against running games, but Ekeler's usage in the passing game keeps him firmly in RB1 territory.","The first Browns player with at least 100 yards on the ground and two rushing scores in consecutive games since Leroy Kelly in 1967, Chubb is proving he can deliver strong fantasy results even amid Kareem Hunt's success. It's not clear if Dallas' rush defense is good or if their pass defense is so permeable that there is a statistical imbalance forming, but Chubb factors as a RB1 candidate either way given his mix of usage and talent.",null,"Higbee is still the clear starter at tight end for the Rams but, after a three-score outing in Week 2, Week 3 brought with it a lackluster performance. Furthermore, the Rams will face a Giants defense that has allowed the seventh-fewest TE fantasy points this season, so a bounce-back Higbee performance seems less likely. He's a low-end starting TE option for this week's game.","Ryan wasn't sharp in Week 3, completing just half of his 38 throws for a season-low 238 yards and one touchdown. A rebound is likely, facing a Packers secondary that has allowed seven scores through the air in what lines up to be a high-scoring Monday night affair. Those disappointed by Ryan's performance last week will likely be happy this week with a potential top-five finish at the QB position.","The Browns didn't have to pass in order to win this past week, thus Landry saw just four targets and shy of 30 total air yards in the win. A more demanding offensive outing against Dallas should see a busier day unfold for Landry. With the Cowboys struggling to contain receivers, things are looking up for Landry.","Hockenson has provided a consistent presence at tight end this season, which is a reassuring sign for the second-year pro. He has at least four receptions and 50 yards in each contest despite changes in the personnel around him in the passing game. Against a New Orleans team that has allowed the most points to opposing tight ends so far this season, he's worth a gamble as a low-end starting option for Week 4.",null,"On the one hand, Sanders is becoming acclimated to the Saints offense, so his role is growing. On the other, his downfield presence isn't consistent with Drew Brees' preference for short passes. Plus, Sanders has to compete with Alvin Kamara and possibly a returning Michael Thomas for targets. Don't roster the recognizable name. The production isn't there.",null,"Losing Jurrell Casey for the year adds to an already devastating series of loses for this defensive roster. The good news is the Jets are the best matchup in fantasy football at the moment in regards to allowing sacks and turnovers without presenting much of a yardage of scoring threat. Given the solid matchup, even Denver's depth issues aren't in the way of fantasy fun.","Samuel had eight touches for 52 yards from scrimmage, both season-highs, as the Panthers took advantage of his versatility with Christian McCaffrey sidelined. Samuel should continue to receive snaps as both a runner and receiver, but not enough to make a fantasy difference against the Cardinals defense in Week 4.",null,"This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","It hasn't been a very productive process facing the Patriots offense, as defenses chase around Cam Newton and the team's deep backfield.

received a contract extension, and former running mate Melvin Gordon is now in Denver, which locks in the former as the Chargers' lead back in 2020. Ekeler took his game to a new level last season, especially as a receiver, ranking no lower than second among backs in targets, receptions, yards and touchdowns. Despite Gordon playing a substantial role in 12 games, Ekeler was fantasy's No. 4 scoring back. Ekeler's small frame will limit his carries and goal-line work (he's never cleared 132 carries or three rushing touchdowns in a season), and he's unlikely to repeat a 91-992-8 receiving line with Tyrod Taylor and Justin Herbert under center. Expect a step back for Ekeler, though his role can still allow borderline RB1 production in PPR.","Chubb has emerged as one of the league's most-effective rushers since being selected in the second round of the 2018 draft. He ranks first in YPC (5.1) and second in YAC (2.3) among 25 backs with at least 300 carries during that span. Chubb was fantasy's No. 8 scoring back in 2019, thanks to the fourth-most touches and second-most total yardage at the position. However, we can't ignore that Chubb's usage and fantasy production dipped once Kareem Hunt returned from suspension (RB6 before, RB15 after). Hunt will be in the mix from the get-go in 2020, which will certainly limit Chubb's output. Consider Chubb a borderline top-10 RB with more value in non-PPR leagues.","The Broncos selected Sutton in the second round of the 2018 draft with the hope that he might emerge as their No. 1 wide receiver. He did exactly that in his second season, posting a 72-1,112-6 receiving line en route to a 19th-place fantasy finish. Sutton was terrific after the catch (5.0 RAC), reliable (only two drops on 124 targets), and productive despite some bad touchdown luck (6 TD, 7.2 OTD). Since entering the league, Sutton ranks sixth in the NFL with 23 end-zone targets. The progression of Noah Fant and the arrival of Melvin Gordon, Jerry Jeudy and KJ Hamler may cost Sutton a few targets, but the 24-year-old will handle enough work to allow for WR2 production.","If someone told you midway through the 2019 season that Higbee was a solid TE1 fantasy option going forward, you would've laughed. The 2016 fourth-round pick had totaled an 86-884-5 receiving line in 58 games through Week 12 of last season. He went on to produce a 43-522-2 line while averaging 11.4 targets per game the rest of the season. Higbee was the top-scoring fantasy TE by 23 points during the span. The 27-year-old signed a contract extension last year and Sean McVay's adjustment to more '12' personnel late last season suggests Higbee's emergence was no fluke. Higbee is best-viewed as mid-range TE1.","Ryan's bizarre roller-coaster career continued in 2019, as his 11th-place fantasy campaign means he has finished outside the top 10 QBs in fantasy points during odd years and no lower than seventh in even years, going all the way back to 2012. In Ryan's defense, he missed a game (his first since 2009) and still played well, ranking top-nine in completion percentage for the eighth consecutive season. Ryan also paced all QBs in completions (408) and finished top-six in passing yards for the 10th straight season. Operating in Dirk Koetter's high-volume offense with Julio Jones, Calvin Ridley, Todd Gurley and five first-round picks on the offensive line, Ryan has a high floor and is a fringe QB1.","Landry was expected to see a big dip in production last season following the Browns' trade for Odell Beckham Jr. Instead, Cleveland's slot man had one of his best NFL seasons and actually out-targeted his teammate 139-132. Landry set a career-high in receiving yardage (1,174) and YPR (14.1) en route to his fifth consecutive top-18 fantasy campaign. Landry has proved to be super reliable, having never missed a game in six seasons and checking in as one of just six players who were targeted in 100% of his 2019 games. New coach Kevin Stefanski could shake things up a bit, but Landry's connection with Baker Mayfield is solid, making him a fine WR3 target.","It's rare for a rookie tight end to make much noise in fantasy, so Hockenson's 32-367-2 line after being selected eighth overall in the 2019 draft should not be viewed as a knock. The Iowa product showed his upside with a 6-131-1 showing in his NFL debut, but managed double-digit fantasy points in only one additional game and missed the final four games due to injury. The 23-year-old is a strong bet for more work in his second season and, as usual for second-year tight ends, will come fairly cheap in the double-digit rounds. Hockenson has the upside to become one of the next great all-around tight ends.","Johnson enters his third NFL season no longer a clear feature back after Detroit drafted D'Andre Swift in the second round. Johnson impressed as a second-round rookie in 2018, averaging 5.4 YPC and catching 84% of his targets, but missed six games. During another injury-plagued campaign in 2019, his receiving workload and rushing efficiency took a hard hit (3.6 YPC) in eight games as Detroit's primary rusher, though he was providing RB2 production prior to a Week 7 injury. Johnson is only 23 years old, but the presence of the more-dynamic Swift is sure to limit his touches. Consider Johnson a flex with limited upside.","Sanders is now 33, but the veteran receiver is well-situated for another season of fantasy relevance after signing with the high-scoring Saints. Sanders is no longer the target hog he was during his prime, but he has nonetheless managed a pair of top-30 fantasy campaigns over the past two seasons. Sanders has seen top-10 finishes in catch rate in both of the past two seasons and figures to work as one of Drew Brees' top targets in the short-to-intermediate area behind Michael Thomas. Sanders is unlikely to be a major asset near the goal line, as he has cleared six touchdowns in a season just once in his career. Nevertheless, he'll see enough volume to warrant weekly flex consideration.","Prater just continues to get the job done. Five of his past eight seasons have resulted in a top-10 fantasy campaign, including three of the past four. Once adjusted for distance, Prater trails only Justin Tucker in field goal accuracy over the past five seasons. He has been cash money from deep, converting on 47 of 61 attempts from 50-plus yards over the past decade; that 77.0% rate is tops in the league during that span. Prater is entering his age-36 season but remains a solid fantasy starter in a Lions offense that figures to improve with a healthy Matthew Stafford.","The Broncos' D/ST has finished in the upper half of the league in fantasy points eight of the past nine seasons and, though 2019 was the exception, there is reason for optimism that Vic Fangio's unit will make a leap in 2020. Denver struggled with big plays last season (27th in forced turnovers and one touchdown), but ranked 12th or better in both yardage and points allowed. The offseason additions of Jurrell Casey and A.J. Bouye, as well as a return to health for Bradley Chubb and Bryce Callahan, more than offset the losses of Chris Harris and Derek Wolfe. Add that to a core that includes Von Miller, Justin Simmons, Kareem Jackson and unheralded AJ Johnson, and the Denver D/ST has the look of a fantasy starter in 2020.","Samuel's career advanced another step last season as the 2017 second-round pick appeared in 16 games for the first time in his career and posted career-high totals in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns. His efficiency wasn't good (51% catch rate, 5.9 YPT), although some of that can be blamed on a 28% off-target rate (eighth highest in the NFL). Samuel did finish as 2019's No. 26 fantasy WR, thanks in part to his also being a factor as a rusher (19-130-1 on the ground). He is sure to sustain a significant role in Matt Rhule's new-look offense, but Carolina's signing of Robby Anderson is sure to cost Samuel targets. As such, he's only a flex option in deeper leagues.","The Denver defense is in excellent shape behind defensive-minded coach Vic Fangio, so the pressure will be on the second-year Lock to get this team back to the playoffs. The 2019 second-round pick failed to make much noise in five starts as a rookie, averaging a weak 6.5 YPA and managing only one weekly fantasy finish better than 20th. Denver is expected to continue leaning on a run-first offense, though Lock's supporting cast is looking much better after the team added Melvin Gordon, Jerry Jeudy and KJ Hamler to a group that already included Courtland Sutton, Noah Fant and Phillip Lindsay. Not a huge factor as a rusher, Lock figures to be limited to mid-to-back-end QB2 production, though he's an obvious deep sleeper in his second season.","Ebron signed with the Steelers after spending the first six seasons of his career in Detroit and Indianapolis. The 2014 first-round pick underachieved during his time with the Lions, but a breakout season in 2018 saw him post a 66-750-13 receiving line. He crashed back to earth last season thanks to predictable regression to the mean, but also due to the loss of Andrew Luck, posting a 31-375-3 line in 11 games. Now with Pittsburgh, the 27-year-old figures to work ahead of Vance McDonald as the team's top receiving tight end. Ebron is best-viewed as a mid-to-back-end TE2.","The Kansas City defense took a big leap forward under Steve Spagnuolo last season and it resulted in an 11th-place fantasy finish for the team's D/ST. The Chiefs haven't finished worse than ninth in interceptions since 2014 or worse than 10th in D/ST touchdowns since 2012. They haven't finished in the upper half of the league in yardage allowed since 2015, but did jump to eighth in points allowed in 2019. Kansas City's defense definitely doesn't pop on paper, but a solid 2019 unit will return its top 11 snap-getters this season. That group includes one of the league's elite players in Chris Jones, as well as stars Tyrann Mathieu and Frank Clark. Led by Tyreek Hill and Mecole Hardman, the Chiefs have at least one kick or punt return touchdown each of the past four seasons.

If you have him on your team and he's slated to play, you start him. Congratulations if you were fortunate enough to draft the Stanford product for your fantasy team. Keep him locked into your lineup for Week 1's contest with the Raiders.","Missing time and missing the end zone held Adams back from the upper echelon of fantasy wideouts in 2019, but his volume and production were still there when he was healthy. His 17.7 points per game total was the second-best of his career and he's still Green Bay's best WR option heading into 2020. The Vikings were among the top-10 most-generous WR fantasy defenses a year ago, so lock in Adams with confidence for Week 1.","With a big new contract on the books, Watson can clearly focus on curating the Houston offense sans his security blanket DeAndre Hopkins. The Chiefs got the better of Watson and the Texans in the playoffs last season, but the Clemson product's unique dual-threat ability keeps him firmly in the starting tier at the position.","Kupp finished the 2019 season on an incredible run of scoring touchdowns. He found paydirt in each of the final five games of the campaign. However, his volume fell off after a promising start, and he took a step back from WR1 status to settle into more of a mid-range fantasy receiver. He remains in that same sort of role heading into his third season. Consider Kupp to be a worthy WR3/flex in Week 1 against a middling Dallas pass defense.","The rare complementary tailback to claim independent fantasy value, Hunt's ability to thrive as a receiving threat on third downs vaults him into the flex tier among tailbacks. The Ravens, however, yielded just 28.4 receiving yards per game to backs last season, third fewest in the league. Given the tough matchup, deploying Hunt in lineups comes with some additional risk.","We have to go back to 2017 for Green's last full season and 1,000-yard effort. With last year's lost season in the rearview, Green enters 2020 with a minor hamstring concern, although tons of potential given a new pairing with an exciting young quarterback. For this first matchup, Green nets a difficult matchup with the Chargers' solid tandem of corners, leaving him in the flex tier among receivers.","Buzz about Dobbins impressing throughout the offseason could help the rookie see the field early for Baltimoreâ€™s run-centric offense. Still likely third in line for meaningful rushing chances behind both his quarterback and fellow tailback Mark Ingram II, it's best to be patient and not deploy Dobbins in lineups just yet for this division matchup with Cleveland.","A somewhat quiet 1,000-yard rushing effort from Lindsay in 2019 should help his case as a busy change-of-pace option alongside Melvin Gordon in the Denver backfield. With Gordon likely to have the lead for valuable goal-to-go and receiving work, Lindsay is found just off the fringe of flex value heading into a matchup with a solid Titans defense.","Slayton found his way to the end zone eight times as a rookie, but went over 100 yards only twice and scored five-or-fewer fantasy points in 50% of his 14 games played. He's definitely a boom-or-bust receiver. Against a solid Pittsburgh defense, it's not wise to bet on a boom in Week 1. Keep him on your bench for now.","A fun usage profile from last season saw the Penn State product enjoy a robust average depth of target of 10.1 yards downfield. While a sluggish catch rate accompanied this healthy aDOT, there is some potential for Gesicki to develop into a seam-busting tight end this season. Unfortunately, this first matchup proves unfriendly given the Patriots allowed the seventh-fewest fantasy points to the position last year.","Will we ever see the 2018 version of Jared Goff again? The Rams' signal-caller was impressive during the team's Super Bowl run but failed to recreate the same magic last year. His offense looks a lot different heading into 2020 with no Todd Gurley II or Brandin Cooks, but you shouldn't ignore that he started to develop some great chemistry with TEs Tyler Higbee and Gerald Everett late last year. Goff isn't quite at the QB1 level in fantasy, but keep an eye on him if you're looking to mix-and-match at the position in 2020.","The selling point for Hooper as a fantasy option begins with consecutive seasons as a top-10 receiving threat at his positions. The downside is the fact Hooper joins a new offense with potential competition for targets and routes from incumbent tight end David Njoku. Given an impressive track record, Hooper qualifies as a starting fantasy option even while facing a solid Ravens defense that allowed the second-fewest yards to tight ends last year.",null,"Seattle's D/ST is not what it once was, and in a road game on the other side of the country, it's probably best to look elsewhere for your Week 1 starter at the position.","Jackson appears to be the top receiver for the Eagles who happens to be healthy heading into Week 1, which provides him with a huge opportunity against a Washington defense that isn't exactly difficult to pass the ball against. Jackson has never been known for his consistency, but there should be plenty of opportunities in Week 1. That means he's well worth a spot in your fantasy lineup as a WR3/flex option."],"2":["Yawn! Week after week, opposing defenses know the Panthers will feed McCaffrey, yet the top fantasy running back always seems to get it done. In the opener, his value came via a pair of rushing touchdowns as he was held in check in the passing game with just three catches for 38 yards. Always a must-start, look for McCaffrey to become even more involved in the aerial game in a Week 2 matchup with an improving Tampa Bay defense.","Adams surprised no one by leading the Packers in targets, receptions and yards in Week 1, ending up as Aaron Rodgers' top target, just like he was for all of last season when healthy. This is the sort of output we should expect from Adams nearly every week and, with the Detroit secondary looking a bit banged up heading into Week 2, the Green Bay receiver is an easy pick as your WR1.","Watson faced nearly endless pressure against the Chiefs in the opener, with Kansas City registering a whopping 45% pressure rate on his dropbacks. The Ravens had the fourth-highest blitz rate of Week 1, adding some risk to Watson's profile, but he's also among the most productive rushing and roll-out playmakers in the league. With his playmaking pedigree on his side, Watson can overcome the challenging matchup.","Kupp finished second to Robert Woods in every key statistical category in Week 1, but still played as a starter and is in the mix as a top fantasy WR option given his track record. Against an Eagles team that finished among the worst in preventing wide receiver fantasy scoring in 2019, he's a solid Week 2 starting option in all leagues.","Out-snapping and earning more touches than Nick Chubb in Week 1 confirmed Hunt's big role on the Browns this season. The Bengals weren't challenged much in the air by the Chargers' backfield, but Hunt should prove busy in such a role this week.","Maybe it was the result of a recent injury in training camp, but Green was third among Bengals receivers in snaps and routes in Week 1. Then again, he had a team-high nine targets and almost secured a big touchdown on an underthrown ball. The Browns are banged up in the secondary, helping Green's profile as a WR2 candidate in Week 2.","A multi-score debut was undeniably impressive, as was leading the backfield with a presence on 40% of offensive snaps in Week 1. While he didn't field a target, Dobbins led the backfield with 14 routes run and was also a meaningful presence in the red zone. With a fairly evenly split committee formed with Mark Ingram, it's not yet time to start Dobbins in lineups, even as Baltimore meets a Houston team that struggled against the rush last week. ","An injury saw Lindsay limited in Week 1, but his snap and touch rate was at least promising. Less promising is this difficult matchup with the Steelers, one of the better rush defenses in the league. ","Slayton rewarded those seeking breakout potential with a stellar Week 1, gathering in 6-of-9 targets for 102 yards and a pair of scores. The second-year wideout is a legitimate deep and red-zone presence on a team where defenses will be preoccupied by Saquon Barkley. Despite the opening week performance, Slayton isnâ€™t quite yet established enough to be placed in fantasy lineups. However, adding him as a reserve would be prudent.","A quick look at the box score from this past week doesn't seem so impressive for Gesicki; the Penn State product netted just 30 yards, after all. But looking deeper into his usage, he played out of the slot for 32 snaps, which is a big rate for a tight end in a league-wide context. The Bills have been solid against tight ends over the past year, though, leaving Gesicki as more of a fringe fantasy consideration.","Goff failed to find the end zone with any of his throws or rushing attempts in Week 1, but his underlying stats (65% completions, 8.9 YPA) were solid. The Eagles do not represent a great matchup, as they were an average pass defense a season ago and performed well in Week 1, so it's best to leave the Rams' passer on your bench or waivers in fantasy this week.","Given just two targets despite ranking second in routes run for the Browns this past week was disappointing. An injury to David Njoku could spell more targets for Hooper, but an ugly opener leaves him on the fringe of starting value entering a meeting with a Bengals defense that struggles to contain tight ends.",null,"The Legion of Boom days are long gone, and this is no longer a fantasy D/ST to trust. This unit failed to net positive fantasy points in Week 1 and face a solid New England offense in Week 2. Look elsewhere for your starter at the position.","Jackson was targeted seven times but managed just two receptions for 46 yards. The Washington defense did a good job shutting down the Eagles offense after Philadelphia jumped out to an early lead, pressuring Carson Wentz so he couldnâ€™t look downfield. Jacksonâ€™s game hinges on his ability to stretch the field and with the Eagles facing another strong pass rush (Rams) in Week 2, he's best suited for best-ball leagues. Using him in traditional formats is too risky."],"3":["Those expending a top pick on McCaffrey received bad news as the star running back has a high-ankle sprain, with an estimated return time of  4-6 weeks.","Adams suffered a hamstring injury in Week 2 against the Lions, but it appears he avoided a serious setback and could be good to go for Week 3. Keep a close eye on his status, as that will be the only reason you'd keep him out of your fantasy lineup. The Saints were one of the weakest teams against wideouts last season (sixth-most fantasy points allowed to the position) so, despite a solid start to 2020, Adams would still be a must-play here if healthy.","The Steelers have one of the pressure rates on defense in the past decade to begin a season. This proves troublesome for any offense, but especially a Houston line that has struggled to protect Watson over the years. Watson has clearly continued to produce strong fantasy results even with a porous line, but this week could prove particularly challenging given the opponent.","Kupp hit 100 total yards in Week 2 but failed to find the end zone, continuing a worrying trend for the former fantasy star. The Bills have a solid pass defense, tied for fifth last season in fewest WR fantasy points allowed, so there's reason to doubt Kupp's viability as a solid starter at receiver. Consider him as more of a flex pick for Week 3.","Another awesomely efficient showing for Hunt included 8.6 yards per rush and seven total first downs on 12 touches. Surely part of the game plan for this meeting with an exploitable Washington defense, Hunt is a fine flex with upside for more.","Green was the targeted receiver on 10 incompletions this past Thursday, the first time in his career he was the target on that many incompletions. The 13 targets is a good thing, the three completions isn't as fun. With promise for some positive regression in working with Joe Burrow, Green is a solid flex for this meeting with the Eagles' exploitable secondary.","Still just serving a change-of-pace role, Dobbins maximized his three touches in Week 2 for 61 scrimmage yards. But with Gus Edwards consuming valuable snaps, Dobbins can't be trusted ahead of a friendly matchup with the Chiefs.",null,"Slayton's Week 2 production dropped significantly as the Bears defend the deep ball well, which is Slayton's bread and butter. It could be another rough week against the tough San Francisco pass defense. Even with the Giants likely putting the ball in the air more without Saquon Barkley, Slayton is no more than a flex option, reliant on a big play or two to come up big.","Busting seams as the key playmaker over the middle for Miami, Gesicki tallied a career showing in Week 2. A strong third outing is quite possible given Jacksonville's issues in coverage in the back seven.","Goff remains an efficient, effective quarterback who lacks fantasy appeal due to his low ceiling. He delivered a trio of touchdowns in Week 2 against the Eagles, but threw for only 267 yards. Since he offers no threat with his legs, either, there are always going to be better options out there. Goff is a safe source of points but not a truly worthy fantasy QB1 against a solid Buffalo pass defense.","The results haven't been very fun just yet, but we can say Hooper is on the field plenty thus far for the Browns. Likely due for some big plays give his share of the offense, Hooper is in the streaming tier among tight ends heading into Week 3's meeting with a suspect secondary.",null,"The Seahawks have not produced positive D/ST fantasy points through two games, and a matchup with Dallas doesn't offer much hope for breaking that trend. Keep this D/ST out of your lineup for Week 3.","Jackson's fantasy utility revolves around his making big plays. Thus far, he and Carson Wentz have been unable to make any downfield connections. This week is as good as it gets for a rebound with the Eagles hosting Cincinnati. Receivers like Jackson with a low floor are always risky, however his upside makes him a strong WR3/flex candidate in Week 3."],"4":["McCaffrey remains on the injured list with a high-ankle sprain. The earliest he can return is Week 6, at home against the Bears.","Adams has been dealing with a hamstring injury and will likely be a gametime call this weekend. Make sure you have a backup plan here.","We saw Watson deliver solid numbers this past week, but he was also sacked five times and chased around for much of the outing. Watson has now been sacked at least five times in 11 outings sine 2017, most in the NFL. It's helps, then, that the Vikings are 31st in sack rate and leaky to receivers at the moment.","The Cooper Kupp we remember so fondly returned in Week 3, hauling in 9-of-10 targets and scoring a touchdown in a high-scoring contest with the Bills. Kupp has been inconsistent for most of the past year, but the upside is still there. With a decent Giants pass defense up in Week 4, Kupp is a solid WR2 pick in all leagues.","Hunt became the third Browns back in the past decade with consecutive games with a receiving score. A blend of high-leverage touches and elite efficiency somehow supports legitimate RB2 value for Hunt. You can expect this gifted back to serve a rewarding dual-threat role against a Dallas team that has struggled badly in pass defense.  ","Yet to really connect with Joe Burrow on a steady basis, Green's slow start is likely due to a series of factors such as rust and a lack of chemistry with his rookie partner. That said, Green is in a good spot to deliver flex value facing a Jaguars secondary that proves suspect to outside receiving threats.","Productive as a receiving threat in Week 3 yet without much usage as a rusher just yet, Dobbins isn't worth playing until his role expands. Washington has been respectable against backfields, so it's easier to avoid Dobbins given these matchup metrics.","Due to serve a sizable role if healthy enough, but for now it appears Melvin Gordon claims the more valuable role of the two heading into a nice matchup with the Jets. Without much clarity about his role on a short week, it's wise to wait and see with Lindsay. ","Slayton caught three balls for a team-high 53 yards in New York's Week 3 loss to the 49ers. With Sterling Shepard still out this week, Slayton should continue to be one of Daniel Jones' primary targets. Slayton registers as a WR3/flex type against a defense ranked as the 12th-most generous in WR yards allowed this season, albeit with only one touchdown.","He only hauled in one of his three targets in Week 3, but made the most of it with a touchdown. It remains notable that Gesicki often is near the team lead for average depth of target, aiding his ceiling for this matchup with a soft Seattle secondary.","Goff had himself a big game in Week 3 against the Bills, racking up 300 yards for the first time this season and scoring three times. We know Goff has potential to be a great fantasy quarterback, but we haven't seen it often enough over the past year. With so many other options and a decent Giants defense up in Week 4 (10th-fewest QB fantasy points allowed), it's a bit too risky to give him the starting spot in your fantasy lineup.","Yet to see the type of rewarding work that led to his breakout year in Atlanta last season, Hooper handled just four targets and 1.5 air yards per target in this past week's win. The Cowboys have allowed 16.5 fantasy points per game in PPR formats to tight ends, helping Hooper's case as a streaming target.",null,"Three takeaways helped the Seahawks provide a decent D/ST return in Week 3 but, for the most part, this is not a great pick given the 80 scoreboard points allowed through three weeks with only five total sacks. That said, the mistake-prone Dolphins are up next, which could provide spot-start value for those looking for a one-week option at the D/ST spot.","Jackson was unable to return for the second half in Sunday's contest, injuring his hamstring after having caught two passes for a tepid 11 yards against the Bengals. Even if he plays this week, Jackson is likely to be hobbled, taking away much of his big-play ability.

returns as the feature back in Carolina after a dominant 2019 campaign, when he outscored the next-closest RB by 156 fantasy points. Seriously. McCaffrey was on the field for an astronomical 93% of the offensive snaps, which was just above his 92% mark in 2018. He set a career high with an 80% carry share (17.9 per game) and has now handled 23% of the targets (8.8/G) in three consecutive seasons. McCaffrey paced the position in snaps, touches, yards, touchdowns, OTD, targets, receptions and carries inside the 5. It's possible McCaffrey will play a bit less in new coach Matt Rhule's offense, but the 24-year-old can afford a reduced role and still dominate the position in fantasy. He should be the first player off the board in your draft.","Adams is back as Aaron Rodgers' unquestioned No. 1 target -- a role that has allowed him to post four consecutive seasons as a top-10 WR in fantasy points per game. Adams handled a career-high 31% target share and was fantasy's No. 2-scoring WR during the 12 weeks in which he was active last season. He finished as a top-five WR in 42% of those outings, which trailed only Michael Thomas. The only concern here is durability as Adams has missed at least one regular-season game due to injury in each of the past three seasons, including four 2019 absences. We'll need to dock him slightly for that, but the 27-year-old's massive usage locks him into the top-end WR1 mix.","Watson enters his fourth NFL season fresh off back-to-back fourth-place finishes in fantasy. The 24-year-old has emerged as one of the game's best players, ranking no lower than eighth in completion percentage and 13th in yards per attempt in each of the past two seasons. Watson has yet to clear 26 passing touchdowns in a season, but he makes up a ton of ground with his legs, ranking top-four in rushing attempts, yards and touchdowns in each of the past two seasons. The elephant in the room is the loss of top weapon DeAndre Hopkins, though it's worth noting that Watson has averaged a strong 9.2 YPA to wide receivers other than Hopkins in his career. Watson remains a solid fantasy starter.","Kupp is a very tricky evaluation following a bizarre 2019 campaign that can be split into two distinct parts. During Weeks 1-12, Kupp played on 87% of snaps and handled a 25% target share. With Tyler Higbee taking on a larger role during Weeks 13-17, those rates dropped to 63% and 15%, respectively. Kupp still ended up fourth in fantasy points due to the strong start and an unsustainable level of touchdown production (10 TD, 5.6 OTD), but we can't overlook the Rams' scheme change in December. The departure of Brandin Cooks definitely helps, but Kupp is now safest-viewed as a mid-to-back-end WR2.","Hunt returns to Cleveland, where he'll operate as a change-of-pace rusher and primary receiving back behind Nick Chubb. Hunt was, of course, one of fantasy's top backs prior to off-field issues leading to roughly one year out of the league. He returned in Week 10 last season and played a substantial role from that point on. Hunt was on the field for 60% of the snaps, handling 5.4 carries and 5.5 targets per game. Hunt was fantasy's No. 17 RB during the stretch and trailed Chubb by only three fantasy points during that span. Chubb will continue to handle most of the carries and goal-line work, but Hunt's role allows him standalone value, not to mention that he's arguably the most valuable insurance policy in fantasy.","Green is back in Cincinnati after missing the entire 2019 season due to injury. Green will enter his age-32 season having missed at least six regular-season games in three of the past four seasons. Despite the durability woes, he has remained a fantasy force, ranking no worse than 16th in fantasy points per game in each of his eight NFL seasons. When we last saw him healthy, Green was fantasy's No. 7-scoring WR through Week 8 of the 2018 season. Green is obviously a risky investment, especially with a rookie quarterback in Joe Burrow, but the superstar receiver can be considered as a WR3 target with obvious upside.","Baltimore grabbed its lead running back of the future by selecting Dobbins with a second-round pick in April's draft. Dobbins is an outstanding athlete with terrific speed, balance and playmaking ability. He sports a 5-foot-9, 209-pound frame and is a three-down option with the ability to contribute as an impact rusher and receiver. In his final season at Ohio State, Dobbins' 2,003 rushing yards and 21 touchdowns tied for tops in this year's rookie class. His 3.5 YAC was sixth. Landing in Baltimore's high-scoring offense sets up Dobbins with a massive long-term ceiling, but he's likely to be utilized as a change-of-pace back in the short term, with Mark Ingram, Gus Edwards and second-year Justice Hill also on the roster. Dobbins won't have much early-season fantasy value but will be a strong end-of-bench stash during the 2020 season.","Lindsay is back in Denver for his third NFL season, but the team's former lead back now figures to settle in as an oft-used change-of-pace runner behind newcomer Melvin Gordon. It's not often you get immediate production from an undrafted player, but Lindsay has produced a pair of 1,000-yard rushing seasons since Denver signed him after the 2018 draft. Lindsay has certainly flashed as a rusher (4.9 career YPC), but he has struggled to produce after contact (1.6 YAC) and as a receiver (4.5 YPT), which explains the team's interest in Gordon. Lindsay's reduced role means he likely won't post his third consecutive top-20 fantasy season, but the 26-year-old is on the flex radar, especially in non-PPR leagues.","In a performance that was eerily similar (albeit not quite as dominant) to the one of the man he helped replace (Odell Beckham Jr.), Slayton missed the first two games of his rookie season before bursting onto the fantasy scene with eight touchdowns in 14 games. Slayton was on the field for 77% of the Giants' pass plays and was WR27 in fantasy points from Week 3 on. Slayton's touchdown rate is far from sustainable (3.5 OTD), but the 2019 fifth-round pick will enter his second season as New York's primary vertical threat. The New York offense has a lot of mouths to feed, but there's certainly a window for Slayton to become the team's No. 1 wideout. Slayton is safest as a flex in deeper leagues.","It was a rough 2019 season for the Dolphins, but that didn't stop Gesicki from quietly taking a big leap forward. The 2018 second-round pick finished the season third among tight ends in pass routes and ranked no lower than 12th in targets, receptions, receiving yards or touchdowns. Gesicki's 11 end zone targets tied for most among tight ends and eighth in the entire league. His 58% catch rate was ugly, but his role as a seam-stretcher (10.1 aDOT) and shaky quarterback accuracy (22% off target rate) were the primary culprits. Gesicki has yet to drop a pass on 120 targets and was fantasy's TE12 in 2019. He's a candidate for another leap forward and a borderline TE1 option.","The Rams' offense took a step back last season, but heavy volume allowed Goff to make occasional noise in fantasy. Goff finished top-five in pass attempts, completions and yards, which helped him to seven top-10 fantasy weeks (fifth most). The 2016 first overall pick has finished 12th, seventh and 13th in fantasy points during Sean McVay's three seasons. He adds very little with his legs (40 rushing yards last season) but still manages to hang in as a streaming option thanks to McVay. In 2020, Goff will have a strong group of targets led by Robert Woods, Tyler Higbee and Cooper Kupp, though the Rams' line remains a concern. Consider Goff a midrange QB2.","Hooper signed with the Browns during the offseason following four seasons with the Falcons. The 2016 third-round pick has finished no lower than seventh among tight ends in routes, targets, receptions or receiving yards each of the past two seasons. He posted career-high marks in targets (96), receptions (75), receiving yards (787) and touchdowns (six) last season despite missing three games and was fantasy's top-scoring tight end prior to suffering an injury in Week 10. Hooper's stock takes hit as he trades Matt Ryan and Atlanta's pass-heavy offense for Baker Mayfield and a Browns offense that also include David Njoku. Hooper enters his age-25 season as a borderline top-10 fantasy option.","John Christian Ka'iminoeauloameka'ikeokekumupa'a \"Ka'imi\" Fairbairn is the latest in a long list of examples of why you should never reach for a kicker in fantasy. The 26-year-old was the top-scoring kicker in 2018, but he crashed back to earth with a 19th-place finish in 2019. Fairbairn's fall was pretty dramatic, as his accuracy plummeted from 88.1% in 2018 to 80.0% in 2019 on field goals and 95.1% in 2018 to 88.9% in 2019 on extra points. Houston also fell from second to 29th in field goal attempts. Houston clearly isn't worried after signing Fairbairn to a four-year extension during the offseason. Fairbairn is a fine pick in the final round of your draft.","The Seahawks' D/ST has been trending down in recent seasons, and the unit's 17th-place 2019 campaign marked its worst finish since 2010. Seattle ranked third in the league with 32 forced turnovers last season, but allowed the seventh-most yards, 19th-most points and finished 29th in sacks. Jadeveon Clowney, Quinton Jefferson and Mychal Kendricks lead the team's list of key offseason losses, though the additions of first-round-pick Jordyn Brooks, Quinton Dunbar and Bruce Irvin to a core that includes Bobby Wagner, K.J. Wright, Shaquill Griffin and Jarran Reed removes some of the sting. This has the look of a midrange fantasy D/ST.","The Eagles reacquired Jackson last offseason in the hope that he would add a vertical element to their offense. Things looked good early on, with Jackson exploding for an 8-154-2 receiving line in Week 1, but it was all downhill from there. Jackson managed only one target the rest of the season due to injury. The Eagles will give it another go with Jackson in 2020, but he's now 33 and hasn't played a full season since 2013.

splitting a pair of games with the rival Browns last season, Jackson impressively compiled six touchdowns in the air while rushing for 166 on the ground. Jackson will be on the move often against one of the leagueâ€™s better pass rushes, a style the dual-threat superstar is well prepared to handle.","Drake emerged as the lead back for the Cardinals late last season and never looked back. He enters 2020 as one of the better options at the RB position given his high volume and pass-catching ability. The 49ers have a formidable run defense, allowing the second-fewest RB points a year ago, but don't let that slow you down. Drake is a must-start until his role drastically changes.","When healthy, Robinson has been among the best wideouts in the NFL over the past several seasons. However, he's been held back by subpar supporting casts for most of that time, limiting him from being a true superstar. Plus, of course, injuries have slowed him down at times, too. All that said, he logged 16 games in 2019 and scored the eighth-most WR fantasy points, so he's a must-start no matter the matchup.","A controversial deal (at least among Houston fans) saw Johnson come over from Arizona this past offseason. Johnson should serve a busy role for the Texans out of the backfield, aiding his fantasy value in a matchup with a Chiefs defense that allowed the second-most fantasy points to backfields last season.","Leaving the Chargers for division rivals in Denver has Gordon positioned to consume a similar workload to what Los Angeles afforded him in 2019. The Titans were one of just 10 teams to allowed as few as 4.0 yards per carry to tailbacks last season, while Gordon's blend of goal-line and receiving upside helps him sustain RB2 value heading into his Denver debut.","McLaurin was a bright spot on an otherwise disappointing offense for Washington in 2019, as his rapport with Dwayne Haskins Jr. was evident. Heading into 2020, he's the team's best player on offense and a start-worthy fantasy option at wide receiver in most weeks. That's especially true against the Eagles, who allowed the fourth-most WR fantasy points last season.","Engram was well on his way to a breakout campaign in 2019 when an injury sent him to the sidelines. He was on pace for 80 receptions and nearly 1,000 yards receiving with six touchdowns in a full season. A healthy Engram can be expected to press toward those totals as a ceiling in 2020. That journey begins in Week 1 against the Steelers. Consider Engram to be a set-and-forget TE option.","Limited to just 28 receiving yards across two matchups with the Browns last season, the hope is the speedy Brown can get past Clevelandâ€™s secondary a few times in the opener. Given some depth issues at safety and difficulties defending receivers after the catch last season for Cleveland, Brown is poised as a solid flex option to start the season.","The Bears started strong as a D/ST unit last season but quickly fell off. They could well repeat that trend with a Week 1 contest against a pedestrian Detroit offense. Chicago allowed only 33 total scoreboard points to the Lions in their two matchups last season, so the floor should be somewhat high here for fantasy success.","A strong rookie showing proves even more impressive in the context of the Steelers' carousel of quarterbacks last season. Johnson is a fun flex option heading into the opener given the Giants allowed the third-most yards to receivers last season.","Yet to be given a full workload in his time with the Texans, we can expect Johnson to serve a change-of-pace role for Houston complementing David Johnson. While not really in the flex tier at the position, it does help Johnson's case this week that the Chiefs were 31st in defending backfields in regards to fantasy production last season.","A big-play producer at Bama, Ruggs will be tasked with stretching the field for the Raiders right away. This initial matchup is pretty fun with the Panthers allowing the fifth-most fantasy points to receivers last season, but there is also obvious risk in trusting a rookie vertical threat in lineups.",null,null,"Cousins has posted impressive completion rates since joining the Vikings (including a career-high 70% in 2018, followed by last year's 69%), but his numbers don't quite translate into fantasy success. He finished just 15th in QB scoring last year, despite playing in 15 games, and his scoring average falls short of the top-tier options you want to build your fantasy team around. He's a name to consider in the right matchups, but unfortunately, the Packers' solid pass defense (sixth-fewest QB fantasy points allowed last year) isn't the place to start."],"2":["All he did to follow up his MVP campaign is deliver his ninth career game with at least three passing scores. Even as the Baltimore backfield struggled to gain ground, Jackson averaged 6.4 yards per rush in Week 1's drubbing of Cleveland. A meeting with the Texans is up next, a defense with the third-lowest pressure rate last week, aiding Jackson's upside inside and out of the pocket this week.","Drake did not see a lot of work in the passing game with DeAndre Hopkins dominating the targets among pass-catchers, but he did get a healthy 16 carries and scored a touchdown against a sturdy San Francisco defense. This week, he'll take on a Washington team that allowed the third-most RB points last season, so there is no reason to take Drake out of your lineup heading into Week 2.","Robinson was the only Chicago receiver to see consistent playing time in Week 1, and that's to be expected of the team's elite wideout. He didn't post eye-catching numbers, but he did enough -- and saw enough volume -- for you to confidently keep him in your lineup moving forward. That's especially true against a lackluster Giants pass defense.","A stellar Houston debut for Johnson included 109 scrimmage yards and a score. The potential absence of Duke Johnson this week to injury could spell another busy day out of the backfield for this vet. The Ravens are a solid defense against backs, but sheer opportunity rate supports RB2 expectations for Johnson.","An injury to Phillip Lindsay aided Gordon's busy stat line in Week 1, but it was admittedly a nearly even split while Lindsay was active. The Steelers stuffed the Giants running game in Week 1, thus Gordon is a somewhat risky flex candidate for Week 2.","McLaurin has the talent to be a top fantasy option, but is currently hindered a bit because fellow sophomore Dwayne Hoskins is still honing his QB skills. Still, McLaurin led Washington receivers with 61 yards on five grabs, despite drawing the coverage of top cornerback Darius Slay, who had been acquired by the Eagles specifically to shut down opposing No. 1 wideouts. Week 2 should be easier sledding for McLaurin as the Cardinals donâ€™t have anyone of Slayâ€™s ilk. Consider McLaurin to be a solid fantasy WR2.","A solid Steelers defense, along with a couple of early missed chances, resulted in a disappointing Week 1 effort from Engram, who was routinely drafted as one of the leagueâ€™s better tight ends. Week 2 should be easier sledding, though, as the Giants travel to the Windy City to play Chicago's not-as-stout defense. Donâ€™t be discouraged. Engram will eventually rebound, and likely this week.","With an awesome 21 air yards per target against the Browns, Brown opened the campaign with a 100-yard effort  Against the Browns, Jackson targeted open receivers 64% of the time, which is his highest percentage in a single game in his career.","The Bears could not manage to make an impact on the fantasy scoreboard as a D/ST in Week 1, and we should expect more of the same moving forward. There simply is not enough consistency in this team's pass rush or in takeaways to merit a spot in your fantasy lineup, not even against an up-and-down Giants offense.","A rough first half in Week 1 saw Johnson bounce back after the break to catch five of 10 second-half targets against the Giants. While JuJu Smith-Schuster was the main weapon in the red zone, Johnson's busy role as a primary read in the offense was a good sign for his value against the Broncos this week.","An ankle injury limited Johnson in Week 1 and has kept him from practice early in the week, signaling real risk that he won't be either available or at his best for this difficult matchup with the Ravens.","The Raiders at least are deploying the rookie speedster right away as a vertical weapon; Ruggs averaged a team-high 19 air yards per target and 18.3 yards per catch in his first game. The Saints have struggled against receivers in regards to fantasy points allowed dating back to Week 10 of last season, setting up Ruggs as a volatile flex.",null,null,"The Vikings were on the back foot on offense in Week 1, getting outplayed by the Packers in a high-scoring contest that left Minnesota chasing the game. Cousins performed well enough, focusing mostly on his favored receiver Adam Thielen, but his overall performance left a lot to be desired. He's not a starting option for Week 2 against the Colts, even if they did look a little bit vulnerable in Week 1 against the Jaguars."],"3":["For how much magic Jackson can create outside of the pocket, it's impressive to note he did most of his damage from within the pocket in Week 2, going 16-of-19 for 172 yards and a score on those attempts. Set for a high-scoring duel with the Chiefs this week, Jackson once against claims on of the highest projections of the slate.","Drake received a healthy 20 carries against Washington in Week 8 and provided a respectable 86 yards on the ground, but his lack of contributions in the passing game so far this season are certainly suboptimal for those banking on him as an every-week back. With only four targets and 14 receiving yards in two games, we want to see more from Drake in the passing game lest we start to slide him down from RB1/RB2 status to more of a flex pick. For now, keep him locked in, especially against a lackluster Lions defense.","If you're able to look past the disappointing three-catch output from Robinson in Week 2, the nine targets he received -- along with healthy playing time -- are still what we've come to expect from the star receiver. Facing a very porous Atlanta defense that's allowed 78 scoreboard points through two weeks, look for Robinson to get back on track as Mitchell Trubisky's top option in the Chicago passing game.","A quiet second showing for Johnson included just 3.8 yards per touch. A lack of playmaking as a receiver limited the fantasy fun this past Sunday. The remedy, unfortunately, might not be found in the matchup this week, as the Steelers are ceding just 3.89 yards per carry to backs, sixth fewest in the league. Given the suspect matchup, Johnson makes for a flex option in Week 3.","Even if he's not so efficient while doing so, Gordon is expected to be quite busy as the lead back for Denver in the games ahead. With Phillip Lindsay sidelined for several weeks, Gordon consolidates strong rushing and receiving workloads. The Bucs have allowed the fewest yards per carry to backs thus far, but Gordon's busy role supports RB2 expectations. ","McLaurin is, by far, Washington's No. 1 receiver. He's garnered a high 26.6% target share, fueling a bulky 32.9% of the club's yards through the air. The Browns will no doubt key on McLaurin in their Week 3 encounter, but he's athletic enough to still have a productive afternoon. The lone bright spot in the Washington passing attack checks in with WR2 status.","In what could be a harbinger of the next few weeks, Engram was the Giants No. 1 receiver after both Saquon Barkley and Sterling Shepard were forced from last week's contest. The 49ers have been one of the best teams at defending the tight end so far in 2020, but they haven't faced anyone of Engram's ilk. Engram's volume alone places him as a low-end TE1 for Week 3.","Lamar Jackson completed just two passes deeper than 15 yards down the field in Week 2, a sure sign Brown had a quiet outing. With Mark Andrews consuming the valuable vertical work, Brown wasn't a fantasy factor this past week. Week 3 could prove more favorable for Brown, as the matchup isn't ideal but the workload could be great. If Baltimore has to keep pace with the Chiefs' offense, Brown could turn in a fun fantasy showing. ","Heading on the road to face Atlanta, the Bears will hope to avoid a repeat of the poor performance they demonstrated in their first away game (against Detroit) this season. Chicago looked solid against the Giants in Week 2 and should be a viable option as a D/ST most weeks, but the Falcons have posted 64 scoreboard points through two weeks and will be looking to bounce back and pick up their first win. Consider Chicago a low-end starting option in Week 3.","It's quite possible that Johnson is already the most valuable receiver on the roster for fantasy purposes; he's paced the team in targets by a significant margin all while averaging 2.1 yards per route. The Texans have been statistically solid against receivers this season, but Johnson merits interest as a solid WR2 thanks to his robust target clip.","An ankle injury kept Johnson off the field in Week 2. If he's good to go this week, Johnson is expected to serve a complementary role that doesn't create much fantasy impact.","There just isn't enough work each week to make Ruggs a fun fantasy option. Sure, it's early, but his role seems to serve more of an impact on stretching the field and changing coverage than him actually producing. Given his lack of usage, this matchup with New England is tough enough to avoid Ruggs in all leagues.",null,null,"Cousins completed only 11 passes in Week 2 and tossed three interceptions -- a horrible showing from a passer who does have QB1 upside in the right matchup. Needless to say, against the Titans he's a non-starter, as Tennesse does not provide a favorable enough matchup to roll with a passer in the midst of such a cold streak."],"4":["Career-lows in passing yards and yards per attempt suggest Week 3 was quite the outlier for Jackson. Moving on from such an ugly outing is a bit easier with a Washington defense dealing with injuries up front. Jackson is due to regain his dual-threat form this week as one of the slate's stronger plays.","Drake has received 18-plus touches in each game so far, which is almost enough to declare him a must-start without any other context. He hasn't found the end zone since Week 1, but that will balance out as the season goes along. The Arizona running back is a solid RB1 option against the Panthers in Week 4.","Robinson flourished in Week 3 despite having two different players under center during the contest. No matter who is at quarterback, Robinson is Chicago's top offensive option and will be a threat in the passing game every week. That remains true even against a very tough Indianapolis defense (fourth-fewest WR fantasy points allowed). Robinson is a low-end WR1 for Week 4.","Houston was held to only 29 net rushing yards in Week 3, the fourth fewest in a game in franchise history and the fewest since 2010. So that's not so good, but what's helpful is Johnson should prove busy in both phases in his capacity as a three-down threat. If Duke Johnson is at full power then this vet isn't as fun from a fantasy perspective, but either way makes for a solid play against a Vikings front allowing 136 rushing yards per game to backfields. ","In just his 10th career game with fewer than 10 carries, Gordon wasn't on the field as much in Week 3 and barely out-performed backfield mate Royce Freeman despite having lots more work. This all said, Gordon is the still the top back for this offense with Phillip Lindsay limited. The Jets, meanwhile, have allowed the ninth-most rushing yards (114.7) to backfields, aiding Gordon's upside for this week.","McLaurin is clearly Dwayne Haskins' go-to guy, getting at least seven looks per game on the way to 16 catches for 269 yards --  a healthy 16.8 yards per catch. Week 4 presents a challenge against the solid Ravens defense. However, with no one else for Haskins to fully trust, McLaurin's athletic ability should be able to shake free for WR2 production.","Engram's production across the board remains down from last season, even though his role should have increased with both Saquon Barkley and Sterling Shepard out last week. The Giants need Engram to step up -- and he has a chance to do so against a Rams defense that has given up  three touchdowns to tight ends. Look for a rebound from Engram who checks in as a low-end TE1 for Week 4.","Even when he doesn't produce, the advanced metrics seem to suggest Brown is due for some big plays soon. For instance, Brown caught just two of his six looks in Week 3, but also averaged an awesome 14.2 air yards per target. With some positive regression on the way soon for his profile, Brown is in a good spot facing a Washington secondary that can struggle with speed.","The Bears have snagged an interception in each game so far but otherwise have lacked the pass rush and turnover generation to be a top-end fantasy D/ST. This week against Indianapolis, consider them as a low-end starting option, especially since Philip Rivers and company have given the ball away only three times so far this season.","This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","Expected to play complementary role whenever healthy, Johnson Jr. isn't a viable fantasy flex with David Johnson playing on so many snaps. ","Ruled out with knee and hamstring injuries, Ruggs missed this past week and isn't a lock for work against this stingy Buffalo defense. Given the Bills' proven and deep coverage group, it's fine to simply stash Ruggs ahead of this meeting.",null,null,"Cousins has become a very TD-dependent fantasy quarterback, racking up start-worthy point totals in the two games in which he's scored touchdowns, and providing a matchup-losing total in Week 2 when he failed to find paydirt. That inconsistency doesn't bode well against a Houston defense allowing the ninth-fewest points to opposing passers this year.

2019 NFL MVP is fresh off a breakout season in which he outscored the next-closest quarterback by 78 fantasy points despite resting in Week 17. The dual-threat weapon threw 36 touchdowns to only six interceptions while adding a record-setting 176-1,206-7 rushing line -- that rushing production alone would've ranked 28th among running backs. The question is: Can he do it again? History says no, as his 9.0% TD rate (highest the NFL has seen over the past decade) is unsustainable, and the last quarterback to repeat as the top-scoring fantasy QB was Daunte Culpepper in 2004. On the other hand, Jackson's rushing volume and prowess give him an extremely high floor, as shown by his 11 top-six fantasy weeks in 15 outings last season. Jackson's unique style makes him an elite fantasy weapon and worth a look early in Round 3.","Drake received the transition tag from the Cardinals during the offseason and will return as the team's clear feature back. Traded from Miami to Arizona at the 2019 trade deadline, Drake went on to play 381 (79%) of 483 possible snaps during his eight games with the team. He handled 66% of the team's carries (15.4 per game) and 14% of the targets (4.4) during that span. That heavy usage allowed him the fourth-most fantasy points among RBs during that span. Arizona's offense should only improve in Kliff Kingsbury and Kyler Murray's second season, so Drake, who sports an impressive 4.8 career YPC, is very much in the RB1 discussion.","It took a while following a lost 2017 due to a torn ACL and a transition to Chicago in 2018, but Robinson has finally reestablished himself as one of the game's top receivers. Last season, Robinson paced all wide receivers in snaps while ranking no lower than sixth in routes, targets, receptions and end-zone targets. A lack of post-catch production (2.6 RAC) limited Robinson's yardage, but he still managed his second career top-eight fantasy campaign. Robinson enters his age-27 season without a reliable quarterback, but he is in his prime with a generous target share. Consider him to be a solid WR2.","Johnson was one of the league's best backs during his first two seasons, but struggles with injuries and efficiency led to a benching last season and was followed by an offseason trade to Houston. The 28-year-old is well-positioned for a rebound campaign with passing-down specialist Duke Johnson as his only competition for touches. The question is: Is he up for it? Johnson averaged an ugly 3.6 YPC and 1.4 YAC during the past three seasons. He remains an effective receiver but figures to focus primarily on rushing the ball with Duke Johnson in the picture. Johnson can't be counted on as an elite fantasy asset, but he has a path to enough volume to allow midrange RB2 production.","Gordon signed on as the Broncos' new lead back, following five seasons with the Chargers. Gordon is fresh off a season when he held out for a month before posting 162-612-8 rushing and 42-296-1 receiving lines. That was enough for the 12th-most fantasy points during that span. Gordon entered 2019 having finished the previous three seasons no lower than ninth in scrimmage yards, sixth in touchdowns and eighth in fantasy points among backs. In Denver's run-heavy offense, Gordon figures to share a chunk of the carries with Phillip Lindsay, but his bigger frame should garner him more goal-line work, and he's also the superior receiver. Gordon is a mid-to-back end RB2.","Washington drafted McLaurin in the second round of the 2019 draft and it took the Ohio State product just one game to solidify himself as the team's top offensive weapon. McLaurin went on to miss a pair of games due to injury, but ranked 17th in fantasy points during the 14 weeks in which he was active. McLaurin was a bit over his head in the touchdown department (7 TD, 5.8 OTD), but saw a healthy 10 end-zone targets (11th most in the NFL) and his 10.0 YPT was ninth best. The 24-year-old is second-year QB Dwayne Haskins' go-to target and a fringe WR2 in fantasy.","Engram is entering his fourth NFL season having missed 14 of 48 possible games due to injury, including five games in 2018 and eight last season. The injuries have held Engram without a top-12 fantasy campaign since 2017, but there's no doubt he's been a major force when healthy. Engram was one of six players who appeared in at least eight games and were targeted at least six times during 100% of those outings last season. The consistent usage helped him to five top-10 fantasy weeks in eight tries (the position's fourth-best rate). We have to knock him a bit for durability concerns, but Engram is still in his prime at age 25 and should be locked into lineups when active.","Baltimore selected Brown in the first round of the 2019 draft and the speedster was immediately slotted in as the team's top wide receiver by default. Brown's boom/bust rookie campaign began with his best game in Week 1 (4-147-2) followed by mixed results (including a pair of missed games) the rest of the way. Brown ended up as the WR46 on the season, thanks to seven touchdowns on 69 targets. His 10.1% TD rate was second highest at the position and certainly unsustainable. Brown is an obvious bet for a boost in targets in his second season as Lamar Jackson's top perimeter target. The 23-year-old is a breakout candidate and a sharp flex target.","One season after dominating the NFL with 55 more fantasy points than any other D/ST, Chicago plummeted to 15th in 2019. The Bears fell from a league-high 11 top-10 fantasy weeks in 2018 to three (24th) in 2019. Chicago was still solid in terms of yardage (eighth) and points (fifth) allowed, but plummeted from first to 22nd in forced turnovers and third to 24th in sacks. On the plus side, impact KR Cordarrelle Patterson scored his fifth return touchdown in as many seasons. The Bears lost three of their top six and seven of their top 12 defenders in terms of snaps during the offseason, including Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, Leonard Floyd and Prince Amukamara. The addition of Robert Quinn and return of Akiem Hicks will help, but, even with the likes of Khalil Mack, Eddie Jackson, Danny Trevathan and Kyle Fuller, this unit isn't nearly as intimidating as it was in 2018. Consider it a back-end starting option.","All things considered, Johnson had a pretty darn impressive rookie season. The 2019 third-round pick was a part-time player for most of the season, but still managed a solid 59-680-5 receiving line on his way to a 39th-place finish in fantasy points. That success came despite his operating in an offense with extremely poor quarterback play. That's unlikely to be an issue again in 2020 with Ben Roethlisberger back from injury. Johnson joins up with JuJu Smith-Schuster, James Washington and rookie Chase Claypool to form one of the league's top young WR groups. Roethlisberger has supported three fantasy-relevant WRs in the past, so it's certainly possible for multiple receivers to shine in Pittsburgh's pass-heavy offense. Consider Johnson as a flex target with upside.","After spending 2019 as a passing-down complement to Carlos Hyde, Johnson is expected to play a similar role behind newcomer David Johnson this season. Johnson has yet to convince a coaching staff that he's worthy of a three-down role, as he has managed only 76 carries per season since entering the league in 2015. Although his targets have dipped the past two seasons, Johnson has been in the upper two thirds in yards per target all five seasons, and his 4.1 OTD (expected TD total) paced the position last season. Johnson's role severely limits his ceiling, and it's possible that he will lose targets to David Johnson this season. Consider the 26-year-old a weak flex in PPR leagues.","The Raiders have a history of targeting speed at wide receivers, so it was no surprise when they selected Ruggs (4.27 40-yard dash) with the 12th pick of April's draft. The 5-foot-11, 188-pound playmaker has great hands, ball skills and is exceptional after the catch. The Alabama product was limited to 55 targets in 2019, but his 13.6 YPT and 10.5 RAC were both top four in this year's rookie class. Ruggs figures to operate as a perimeter lid-lifter and returner in the pros, which would be good news in the explosive-play department, but it could cap his target upside. That said, the Raiders have such a severe need at wideout that Ruggs is very likely to step right into an every-down role. The Raiders' new No. 1 wide receiver is a borderline flex in 2020 leagues.","Gould is back with the NFC Champion 49ers after a 2019 campaign that saw him stumble to 17th in fantasy points. That was quite the step back for a player who had finished his previous three full seasons as a top-seven fantasy kicker. It's fair to wonder if age is becoming a factor for the 37-year-old, as last season's 74.2% field goal percentage was the worst of his career, though perhaps it was a fluke after he paced the league at 96.5% over the previous three seasons. Despite the down year, Gould should be viewed as a solid fantasy starter in a Niners' offense that has ranked no lower than seventh in field goal attempts in each of the past three seasons.","","Cousins may be conservative, but there's no denying he was one of the league's most effective passers last season. The eight-year vet completed 69% of his passes (top-5 for the second consecutive season) and posted an 8.1 YPA (seventh best). Despite the efficiency, Cousins was not a good fantasy QB. Minnesota's run-heavy offense was problematic, as he posted one weekly finish better than sixth and was outside the top 20 in eight of 15 starts. Cousins hasn't used his legs as often in Minnesota as he did in Washington, which has been a factor in his 12th-   and 15th-place finishes among QBs in fantasy during the past two seasons.

Broncos were solid against the run last season in surrendering just 4.0 yards per carry to opposing backfields, but their front seven faces a serious challenge with the bruising Henry. Leading the league in rushing by nearly 200 yards last season and with some preseason talk of him getting more work as a receiver fuels RB1 status for Henry heading into this prime-time conference meeting.","Jones fell six yards shy of his sixth straight 1,400-yard season in 2019 and enters 2020 seemingly healthy and ready to go. He's never quite scored as many touchdowns as fantasy managers might be hoping for, but that hasn't stopped him from being a dominant fantasy option on a weekly basis. Against a middling Seattle pass defense, Jones is a must-start WR1 in Week 1.","A breakout 2019 effort saw Andrews overcome a modest snap rate by consuming a dominant share of the Baltimore passing offense. Now that there is less competition for snaps and routes with Hayden Hurst down in Atlanta, Andrews is positioned as a solid starting fantasy force heading into this opening matchup with a Cleveland team that allowed tight ends to haul in 68% of their targets last season.","Woods was a difficult player to assess in fantasy last year, hauling in 90 passes for over 1,100 yards but only finding the end zone three times -- and just twice as a receiver. With Brandin Cooks no longer on the team, he and Cooper Kupp will be Jared Goff's top two wideouts, but the emergence of the tight end in the Los Angeles offense might limit the TD upside for Woods. Still, the consistency of an 80-catch, 1,000-yard receiver is worth a spot in your lineups most weeks, including Week 1 against Dallas.","A glaringly inefficient 2019 saw Bell struggle as both a rusher and receiver, but netting 311 touches helped offset such issues. Focusing on his potential in this first matchup of 2020, the Bills weren't stellar against the run in regards to yardage allowance to opposing backfields, but they did yield just the 10th-fewest scores to backs. Assuming Bell nets a big workload, he's somewhere in the RB2 or flex range among backs for this division matchup.","Are you used to seeing Brady's name without \"New England\" or \"Patriots\" next to it yet? The veteran has joined the Buccaneers and should pick up right where he left off as a capable, efficient passer who lacks a bit of upside, given his age. The New Orleans pass defense is nothing to be too concerned with, so lock in Brady as your starting passer for Week 1.","An incredible finish to the season saw Parker finish as a top 12 fantasy producer in 2019. With more competition for targets from his positional peers and with a brutal first matchup against the league's top pass defense from last season, Parker is best considered a flex play to open the campaign.","As it stands, Cohen is on top of the Bears' RB depth chart for Week 1, with second-year back David Montgomery looking likely to miss action due to a groin injury. However, Cohen is not an every-down back and should see little by way of a boost if his teammate is indeed sidelined. Cohen had more receptions than carries a year ago, and that's why you want him on your fantasy team -- especially in PPR formats. He's got a low ceiling but a fairly high floor and merits consideration as an RB2/flex in most leagues against a lackluster Detroit defense.","With a fantasy-friendly role over the past several seasons that proves ideal for PPR formats, White's statistical floor isn't quite as stable now that Tom Brady is in Florida. Then again, Cam Newton successfully fed a famous PPR maven in Carolina for several seasons, so there is some potential for this transition to prove smooth. The Dolphins allowed nearly nine yards per reception to backs last season, well above league average, helping White's case as a flex option for the opener.","While Gardner Minshew avoided turnovers in the passing phase last season, there is some big-play potential for this Colts D/ST facing a green quarterback at the helm of a shallow offense. The Colts were banged up on defense last season, but figure to enter the campaign at full force.","Kirk didn't exactly \"break out\" in Year 2, but he picked up more work as a receiver and posted career-highs across the board. As Larry Fitzgerald gets even closer to riding off into retirement, Kirk should grow into a solid role as the No. 2 receiver behind DeAndre Hopkins. For now, though, with all three receivers in the lineup and a great pass-catching back in Kenyan Drake, it's hard to trust Kirk as anything more than a flex option, given so much competition for targets.","Jones provided surprisingly good numbers at times in 2019, averaging over 22 points per contest -- with a nice chunk of rushing production to provide a floor for his passing efforts. However, he'll face Pittsburgh (a top-10 pass defense from last season) in Week 1. If you have other options, you might want to consider them in this instance.","An injury to Trey Burton means Doyle could be on the field a lot for the Colts to open the season. The Jaguars were respectable in defending tight ends in 2019, but a volume of snaps and targets could help Doyle flirt with fantasy relevance this week.",null,"Seemingly healthy for the first time in his pro career, this Ohio State product makes for a solid sleeper option now that Philip Rivers brings some needed consistency to the Colts' passing game. Not yet trustworthy for fantasy purposes given his lack of track record, Campbell is a nice depth option heading into this division meeting with a soft Jacksonville defense.","Gibson's rise to stardom is straight out of a movie script, as the unheralded small-school back transferred to Memphis, made big plays and earned a spot on an NFL roster. He then played his way into what looks like a starting role to begin his rookie season. He'll face the Eagles in his first pro game -- a team stout against the run. To say Gibson lacks experience is an understatement, so consider him as no more than a flex flier for your Week 1 lineups."],"2":["Delivering his league-leading seventh 100-yard rushing performance since the start of last season, Henry handled an astounding 34 touches in the rousing win over the Broncos this past Monday. The Jaguars coughed up gobs of scrimmage yardage to the Colts' backfield in Week 1, aiding Henry's case as arguably the best play at the position this week.","Jones led the league in receiving yards during Week 1 with 157 yards on nine catches (12 targets), though he didn't find the end zone. This week, he faces a Cowboys secondary which lost two of last season's starters to free agency, including top CB Brian Jones who would have drawn coverage here. Jones is matchup proof, with a solid chance to be among the league leaders in receiving yards again this week.","In just his third NFL appearance with at least 42 snaps, Andrews thrived as the unquestioned lead tight end after serving in more of a committee approach last year. You can't expect multi-score outings each week from Andrews, but facing a weaker Houston back seven that has allowed the most yards per game to tight ends since Week 10 of last year results in a healthy projection.","Woods came out ahead of Cooper Kupp in Week 1, hauling in more passes and seeing more targets than his fellow top wideout. This situation will be rather unpredictable all season long, but both players are usually solid starting options given their combined share of the Los Angeles passing game. That remains true in Week 2 against an Eagles defense that struggled against receivers a year ago.","Held to only 2.3 YPC on his first six rushing attempts this past Sunday before going down with a hamstring ailment, Bell continued on last year's trend that saw him finish with the fewest yards per carry among backs with 200 totes. It's not clear how long Bell might need to get back from this hamstring issue, so managers will want to identify other options if he's not available for this unsavory matchup with the 49ers. ","Fans of both the Patriots and Buccaneers flashed back to last season as Brady was intercepted twice, including a pick-six. He did rush for one score and threw for another as part of his 239-yard day in the air. The veteran has been written off several times, only to rebound each time with a vengeance. Look, he deserves the benefit of the doubt in Week 2, especially when taking on a beatable Panthers defense in what will be the Buccaneers' home opener.","Hauling in all four of his targets for 47 yards before leaving with the dreaded hamstring injury, Parker looked good when available. Availability is a key factor for Parker's fantasy profile this week, but it's also worth noting the Bills present a very tough matchup in the secondary. Adding up the risk factors, Parker's managers will want to have some strong alternatives prepared.","Cohen saw 50% of the RB snaps in Week 1, but opportunities were few and far between. That's the risk with Cohen, who is a passing-game specialist that plays alongside David Montgomery, who is the one who gets all of the carries. The Giants don't have a great pass defense, so Cohen is worth a shot as a flex in most leagues. Still, you may have safer options with more upside to use in that spot.","Limited to 10 touches, White was at least a factor in the passing phase in what was the Cam Newton show for the Patriots. An uptick in passing work would be nice for this flex option in PPR formats -- which is possible in a game that could demand more offensive diversity against the Seahawks.","The Colts produced the third-highest pressure rate in the league in Week 1, only it didn't really seem to bother Gardner Minshew II's wily performance. Without many established big play elements on this defense and Minnesota's seemingly conservative offense up next, you can find stronger streaming candidates than the Colts.  ","Kirk couldn't find his rhythm in Week 1, catching only one of his five targets and failing to even pick up a yard on his lone reception. That said, five targets was still good enough for a three-way tie for second on the Arizona offense, which is about where we expected Kirk to be heading into the season. He's still a flex option, albiet a low-ceiling one, heading into Week 2 against a Washington defense that looks to be improved, though not unbeatable.","In Week 1, Jones picked up right where he left off last season, mixing flashes of strong play with untimely mistakes, ultimately finishing with 279 passing yards, a pair of touchdowns, and two costly picks. Granted, Jones did draw the tough Steelers defense in Week 1, but the poor decisions were on him. Even though Jones faces a less fierce Bears unit this week, look for Saquon Barkley to shine. Leave Jones on the fantasy bench.","A 28-yard catch-and-run play helped fuel a respectable first showing for this streaming candidate among tight ends. The Colts spread the ball around a good deal and the Vikings have been stingy against tight ends dating back to last season, factors further limiting the appeal for Doyle.",null,"The Ohio State product led the team in routes and tied for the lead in targets in a strong opening outing. It was good to see Campbell run 58 of his 62 snaps from the slot, per Pro Football Focus, evidence he could enjoy advantageous matchups -- including this week against the Vikings -- going forward.","The rookie impressed in his NFL debut, leading Washington in rushing. He had 36 yards on nine carries, while also catching a pair of throws for another eight yards. Gibsonâ€™s six-foot, 228-pound frame shows potential for heavy usage but, for now, his touches will be limited. Those in keeper and dynasty leagues should be excited. Just donâ€™t expect much early this season, including in Week 2. Heâ€™s a bye-week stash, at best."],"3":["Scoreless through two appearances despite gobs of touches, Henry's 84 rushing yards in Week 2 marked his fewest since Week 9 of last season. Due for some scoring success as the engine of the Tennessee ground game, Henry should thrive during a matchup with a Vikings defense allowing 140 rushing yards per game to backs this season.","After an outstanding opening week, Jones was hampered with a sore hamstring in last week's last-second loss to the Cowboys, catching two balls for just 24 yards. The Bears' pass defense is tough on wideouts so it may be another week before Jones finds the end zone for the first time this season. With a week to heal and a history of playing through injuries, Jones remains a must-start, though it's worth monitoring practice reports, especially late in the week.","Lamar Jackson didn't push the ball outside in Week 2 and instead kept the ball underneath in a conservative showing. Andrews was limited to just one haul, but is expected to prove busy in a higher-scoring affair with the Chiefs. Kansas City has been solid in coverage, but volume and red zone attention both work in Andrews' favor.","Woods took a step back in Week 2 as a receiver, hauling in only 14 yards worth of passes. He did, however, score a rushing touchdown to salvage a decent day from a fantasy perspective. Still, the Rams offense is not running at maximum efficiency and the Bills have a solid pass defense. Consider Woods as more of a WR2 option for the week ahead.","Placed on injured reserve with a hamstring injury, we won't be seeing Bell for several weeks.","Brady's second game in a Buccaneers uniform resulted in a victory, though his performance was just so-so. He threw for 217 yards with a touchdown and another pick. In his defense, Brady was without Chris Godwin and Mike Evans was coming off a week where he was hobbled with a sore hamstring. This week, Brady is a borderline QB1 as he'll square off with a Denver defense that's a far cry from its championship days.","It was encouraging that amid injury concerns that Parker played on a team-high 43 routes in Week 2, helping lead to his touchdown. The Jaguars aren't particularly stingy on the outside, helping Parker's bid as a WR3 this week.","Cohen's volume has been concering to start the season, as he's received only 12 carries and three targets after two games. David Montgomery is getting more and more involved in the Bears passing game, which eliminates one of Cohen's biggest strengths. Meanwhile, Cordarrelle Patterson has stepped into a bigger role as a runner and seems to be directly cutting into Cohen's opportunities. Keep Cohen on the bench, even against a poor Atlanta defense in Week 3.","Some devastating personal news saw White sit out Week 2. If he's active for this looming matchup with the Raiders, it helps White's case that the Raiders' front seven struggles in coverage.","The Colts held Kirk Cousins to the worst completion rate (42%) and most interceptions (three) of his Vikings career. With some real momentum as a pass defense, the Colts next face a struggling Jets offense that has yet to take flight.","Kirk saw fewer targets and played on fewer snaps than veteran Larry Fitzgerald in Week 2, which is a major issue for those relying on Kirk as a starting wideout in fantasy. If he's truly splitting work with Fitzgerald behind fantasy superstar DeAndre Hopkins, that likely leaves both as risky flex picks every week. Against the Lions' porous pass defense, consisder Kirk no more than a low-end WR3/flex option.","Jones will be asked to step up with Saquon Barkley out for the season. The second-year signal-caller rallied the Giants from a 17-0 halftime deficit to  fall just short of beating the Bears in a narrow 17-13 loss. Even so, Jones has a tall task this week, facing a stingy 49ers defense. If Jones is your fantasy backup, it could be time to look for an upgrade.","Knee and ankle injuries held Doyle out of Week 2, which saw positional peer Mo Alie-Cox erupt with a career performance. If Doyle can go this week, facing a depleted Jets back seven is an inviting matchup. With Alie-Cox on the rise, however, Doyle is likely more of a TE2 than an actual streaming option.",null,"Campbell had to be carted off the field after he suffered a left knee injury in the first quarter in Week 2. A PCL injury figures to sideline Campbell indefinitely, with rookie Michael Pittman Jr. as a clear beneficiary.","In his second game as a pro, Gibson scampered for 55 yards on 13 totes, including his first career touchdown. After finishing with the fewest snaps among the backfield corps in the opening week, Gibson led all backs in Week 2. The increased volume will help this week as Washington faces a Browns defense allowing the third-fewest yards on the ground. Gibson should be considered as a flex candidate for Week 3."],"4":["This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","Jones was inactive with a sore hamstring for last week's game with the Bears. He was, however, a game-time decision which lends hope he can return Monday night against the Packers in what should be a high-scoring affair. Monitor injury reports, as an extra day to heal could help Jones. However, that also puts his fantasy teams in a bind if he can't go.","Close to a much bigger game this past Monday with a few missed connections down the seam and in the red zone. Andrews' rough Week 3 seems more like an outlier than trend. The Washington Football Team, meanwhile, has allowed just over 57 yards per game to tight ends, setting up Andrews for a solid showing.","Woods and Cooper Kupp continue to lead the way at receiver for the Rams -- and both provided start-worthy stat lines in Week 3. The Giants have been decent against the pass so far this season, but have still allowed the 13th-most WR fantasy points, giving both Woods and Kupp room to be stars in Week 4. Consider Woods to be a solid WR2/flex pick.",null,"Buoyed by a pair of one-yard scoring strikes to Mike Evans, in Week 3 Brady posted his best game with the Buccaneers, throwing for 297 yards and three touchdowns. A repeat will be a tall task as next up is a Chargers defense giving up the eighth-fewest aerial yards (with just three touchdowns). The potential momnetum is certainly encouraging, but Brady remains a matchup play. As such, this isn't the week to deploy the veteran.","The Dolphins didn't have to drop back very often in Week 3, but it does prove promising for his durability that Parker was able to lead the team in routes run. Seattle has allowed more fantasy points to receivers than any other team by a wide margin, supporting WR3 value for Parker in Week 4.","The Bears have placed Cohen on season-ending injured reserve due to a torn ACL he suffered in Week 3.","Still away from the team with a personal matter, White would resume his valuable role as the team's top receiving threat out of the backfield and with real red zone pedigree. The Chiefs have struggled to contain backs this season, with White positioned as a solid flex if he's active.","The Colts scored two defensive scores in a game for the first time since 2014 and as a franchise had just two pick-sixes in the prior four seasons. The Colts next face a surging Chicago offense with Nick Foles, but given Indy's 34.8% pressure rate, which is third-highest, this D/ST remains in the starting mix.","Kirk sat out the Cardinals' Week 3 contest against Detroit, and his status for Week 4 is up in the air. Should he return, he'll rejoin a WR unit that is very top-heavy, with DeAndre Hopkins leading the NFL in targets. No other wideout seems to have a consistent handle on the volume needed to be a fantasy starter. Look elsewhere for Week 4.","After throwing twice as many touchdowns as picks in his rookie campaign, Jones has flipped the script with just two scores and four interceptions through three games of 2020. Being without Saquon Barkley and Sterling Shepard obviously hurt him in Week 3 and will continue to be a big barrier this week against the Rams. Jones could have some success running the ball in Week 4, but his passing numbers project to fall well short of what's needed for a fantasy start.","We've learned that managers can't trust Doyle as a starting fantasy option now that he's competing with Moe Alie-Cox for meaningful targets. Simply put, there just isn't room in this offense to support two tight ends, especially in a tough matchup with Chicago.",null,null,"Despite trailing J.D. McKissic in snaps, Gibson was more productive in Week 3, tallying 60 yards from scrimmage on a dozen touches, including one for a rushing score. In Week 4, Gibson will face the toughest test of his rookie season in a road affair with the Ravens.

returns as the feature back in Tennessee after pacing the NFL in carries (303), rushing yards (1,540) and rushing touchdowns (16) in 2019. Henry has been an absolute force as a rusher, ranking no lower than third in YAC each of the past three seasons. His heavy recent workload is a concern, but the good news is that he's 25 years old and had not cleared 215 carries in a season prior to 2019. Henry's minimal workload as a receiver (career-high 18 receptions last season) will continue to limit his fantasy output, so coupled with a probable dip in rushing production, he should be valued as a back-end RB1.","Jones is now 31 years old but remains an elite fantasy weapon as Matt Ryan's top target in the pass-heavy Atlanta offense. Jones continues to underwhelm in the touchdown department (only 6.2 scores per season since 2014), but he more than makes up for it with both massive targets (10.5 per game over the past two seasons) and receiving yardage (ranked among the top three WRs in each of the past six seasons). Jones' career-low YPT and RAC marks last season are a slight concern for a player now in his 30s, but his heavy usage positions him well for a run at a seventh straight top-seven fantasy campaign. Draft him in the second round.","A 2018 third-round pick, Andrews exited his rookie campaign seemingly set to become one of the league's next great tight ends. It's fair to say he delivered the goods in 2019. Despite ranking 40th at the position in snaps, Andrews handled a massive 25% target share for Baltimore's league-best offense en route to a TE5 fantasy campaign. Andrews' 11 end zone targets tied for most among tight ends and eighth in the entire league. That helped him to 10 touchdowns. Andrews' has ranked no lower than fifth in aDOT or YPR during his two pro seasons. Lamar Jackson's top target enters his age-24 season as a solid TE1 option.","Woods doesn't get the headlines, but the 2013 second-round pick has emerged as the high-scoring Rams' No. 1 wide receiver. A top-15 fantasy WR in both of the past two seasons, Woods was targeted nine-plus times in 10 of his 15 games last season. That 67% rate was tied with DJ Moore for fifth best in the league. Woods isn't going to get you many touchdowns, as he's never been above six in a season and saw only two end-zone targets last season. Still, he's a strong bet to push for 130 targets for the third consecutive season. Especially with Brandin Cooks gone, Woods is a fine WR2 target in PPR leagues.","Despite a healthy dose of turmoil during the 2019 season, Bell is back as the Jets' feature back. Bell's first season in New York saw him rank no lower than 11th among backs in carries, targets, receptions and receiving yards. However, Bell ended up just 16th among backs in fantasy points, due to a low touchdown total (four) and horrific efficiency (3.2 YPC, 5.9 YPT). Bell's heavy volume allowed him a high floor (double-digit points all but one week), but he no longer has an elite ceiling (one weekly finish better than ninth). Bell is now 28 years old and hasn't appeared in 16 regular-season games since 2014. He's no longer an RB1, though an improved Jets offensive line helps his 2020 prospects.","In case you were living under a rock during the offseason, Tom Brady is now on the Buccaneers. The 43-year-old hasn't been much of a fantasy force in recent seasons, having finished 12th or worse among QBs in fantasy points in three of the past four seasons and four of the past seven. He's also coming off arguably his worst professional season (24 pass TDs, 61% completion rate, 6.6 YPA). Of course, there's plenty of reason to expect a bounce-back in Tampa, as his top targets go from Julian Edelman, James White and Mohamed Sanu to Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and old friend Rob Gronkowski. Brady adds very little with his legs but avoids turnovers and figures to push the ball downfield more in Bruce Arians' high-volume, pass-first attack. Consider the GOAT a back-end QB1.","It's not often that a player realizes his potential in his fifth NFL season, but that was exactly what happened for Parker last season. After failing to post a single top-50 campaign while totaling nine touchdowns during his first four seasons in Miami, Parker exploded for a 72-1,202-9 receiving line in his first year working with Brian Flores. He ended up as fantasy's No. 11 WR and finished top five in routes run, receiving yards and touchdowns. The 27-year-old has first-round pedigree and had suffered through several injuries, so the leap wasn't a major shock, but we also should proceed with caution in 2020. Miami's top offensive target is safest when targeted as a WR3.","Cohen returns as Chicago's change-of-pace and extremely-busy receiving back. Believe it or not, Cohen ranks fourth among backs in both targets (261) and receptions (203) since entering the NFL in 2017. Cohen's 190-pound frame has limited him to no more than 99 carries in a single season and a grand total of four carries inside the 5-yard line. However, 70-plus catches each of the past two seasons has helped him to fantasy finishes of 11th in 2018 and 27th in 2019. Cohen's efficiency was extremely poor last season (3.3 YPC, 4.4 YPT), and he'll remain limited as a rusher and at the goal line, but his role isn't expected to change in 2020, which locks him into the PPR flex discussion.","White has finished as a top-20 fantasy RB each of the past two seasons, but he's a bit of a wild card now that old reliable Tom Brady is out of the picture. We can't bank on carries from White (he has never cleared 94 in a single season), but he has ranked no lower than sixth among backs in targets, catches, receiving yards and touchdown receptions each of the past two seasons. White is a strong bet to remain New England's primary passing-down back, but we can't assume Cam Newton or Jarrett Stidham will target him as often, and the safe bet would be to expect less scoring and a more run-heavy approach from the Patriots' offense. White still has PPR value, but he's more of a fringe flex with a limited ceiling.","The Colts' D/ST has finished 13th in fantasy points each of the past two seasons, but the unit is trending up following the offseason acquisition of star DT DeForest Buckner. The former 49ers standout should help generate pressure for a unit that has finished top 10 in interceptions each of the past two seasons, but 15th or worse in sacks each of the past five seasons. The Indianapolis defense otherwise saw only minor offseason turnover and returns a unit led by Buckner, Justin Houston, Darius Leonard, Kenny Moore and Malik Hooker. As an added bonus, Nyheim Hines was responsible for two of the league's seven punt return touchdowns last season. Consider the Colts' D/ST a midrange starting unit.","After flashing in a situational role as a rookie in 2018, Kirk saw a boost in usage and was the WR29 during 13 active weeks last season. The former second-round pick handled a very generous 24% target share in his first season with Kyler Murray in Kliff Kingsbury's system. However, he didn't see much work near the goal line (only four end-zone targets) and his 6.8 YPT ranked near the basement of the league. Moving forward, Kirk is a near lock for a big reduction in targets with superstar DeAndre Hopkins now sitting atop the depth chart. Kirk, who has already missed seven games due to injury, will also need to fend off Larry Fitzgerald, Hakeem Butler and Andy Isabella (among others) for targets. The 23-year-old is no more than a borderline flex in deeper leagues.","Jones was in and out of the lineup during his rookie campaign, but the 2019 sixth overall pick certainly made an impact when on the field. During 12 starts, Jones paced all rookie QBs with 24 pass TDs and was fifth in fantasy points. Jones' efficiency wasn't good (62% completion rate, 6.6 YPA), but inconsistency is common for rookie passers. Despite the Giants' top targets playing zero games together due to injury, the New York offense ranked 13th in touchdowns during Jones' rookie campaign. Jones is armed with a solid supporting cast and adds value with his legs (he ranked seventh in rushing yards as a rookie). Consider him a fringe top-12 QB and a breakout candidate.","With Eric Ebron out of the picture, Doyle has regained his status as the Colts' clear top tight end. We got a glimpse of what that could look like late last season as Doyle tied for the team lead with 31 targets (20% share) once Ebron went on IR after Week 12. Doyle was held to two top-10 fantasy weeks and one finish better than eighth on the season, but there are reasons for optimism. Coach Frank Reich's tight end units have never combined for a target share below 23% in six seasons as a coach/OC. Also, new QB Philip Rivers made heavy usage of Antonio Gates and Hunter Henry in recent years with the Chargers. Doyle, who ranked sixth at tight end with eight end zone targets last season, should be viewed as a fringe top-15 fantasy TE in his age-30 season.","After failing to make an impact during his first two NFL seasons, Gonzalez surged to the sixth-most fantasy points at the position in 2019. In what was his first full season with Arizona, Gonzalez produced 11 top-10 fantasy weeks, which tied for most. His 35 field goal attempts were third most in the league and, though his 88.6% field goal percentage was eighth best, it was certainly inflated by an average distance of 33.5 yards, which was the shortest in the league. Arizona's offense is a candidate for a leap in quarterback Kyler Murray's second season, which makes Gonzalez a fine last-round flier.","A 2019 second-round pick, Campbell appeared to be well-positioned for a huge rookie season in the WR-needy Indianapolis offense. Instead, the speedy short-area weapon was limited by injury to a mere 22 touches in seven games. Campbell will be an intriguing post-hype sleeper in his second season, especially with Philip Rivers now under center. The Colts' depth chart remains wide open behind 30-year-old T.Y. Hilton, with Campbell and rookie Michael Pittman Jr. likely to handle big roles. Campbell is super-fast (a 4.31 40-yard dash) and quick (a 4.03 short shuttle) with the ability to contribute from the slot, as a rusher and as a returner. He's well worth grabbing for your bench.","Washington selected Gibson with the 66th pick of April's draft. Gibson appeared to be entering the league as more of an 'offensive weapon' than a wide receiver or running back, but he has settled in as the team's lead back, even drawing comparisons to Christian McCaffrey by head coach Ron Rivera. The Memphis product is big (6-foot, 228 pounds) and a terrific athlete with excellent power, speed (4.39 40-yard dash) and elusiveness. He's a terror with the ball in his hands, having averaged 8.4 yards per carry and 13.1 yards per target (11.9 RAC) in 2019. Experience is a concern here (33 carries and 66 targets in two FBS seasons), but it appears he's done enough to play a huge role as a rookie.

leader at his position in fantasy production in each of the past four seasons, Kelce is a must-start fantasy superstar at this point of his career. It's fun to consider what he can accomplish to open the season heading into a matchup with a Houston defense that allowed the seventh-most yards to tight ends in 2019.","The best tight end in fantasy football is back and ready for business. The focal point of his team's offense, he thrives as a point-per-reception machine at a position often led by players who are far more TD-dependent. Kittle can score, as well, but he doesn't have to do so in order to deliver a great performance for you each week. In Week 1, he's facing the best matchup a tight end can find in the NFL, the Arizona Cardinals. This is as no-brainer a decision as it gets. ",null,null,"Metcalf made his fair share of big plays in his rookie campaign, averaging over 15.0 YPC and scoring seven times. A favorite of those who look to advanced metrics to judge fantasy potential, Metcalf has both the size and ability to be a force in Year 2. He's well worth a spot in your lineup as a WR3/flex against a middling Falcons defense.","Unique consistency from this D/ST -- which has finished in the top eight in fantasy points in four of the past five seasons -- helps fuel confidence for a strong debut against a young and mistake-prone Giants offense. With proven pass rushers and playmakers in the back seven, Pittsburgh is a top D/ST option for Week 1.","A savvy blend of playmakers at each level of this defense combined with strong scheming helps this D/ST sustain value as a high-end fantasy option. For a defense that allowed just 5.3 yards per dropback to opponents last year, a meeting with a seemingly limited Jets offense sets up a good start to the campaign. ","The Eagles tried to add some more talent at the WR position this offseason by drafting Jalen Reagor. However, he's unlikely to play in Week 1, leaving Wentz with a similarly inconsistent crew to the one he struggled with at times last year. He's a start-worthy quarterback most weeks given his volume, but his upside is amplified against a porous Washington defense in Week 1. Start him in any league, even with many of his receivers hurt.","Mattison is the backup to a proven starter on a team that loves to run the ball, meaning his value is almost entirely dependent on the health and availability of Dalvin Cook. In Week 1, with Cook healthy, Mattison lacks fantasy upside. Keep him around as a backup plan.","A shoulder injury in camp could see Williams miss this friendly first matchup with the Bengals, according to reports. A proven big-play threat who averaged 20.4 yards per catch last season, managers might need to prove patient with Williams to open the season.","Lazard has emerged from the Packers' WR ranks as the most likely to start alongside Davante Adams, but he's unlikely to soar to super-stardom based solely on that new role. Green Bay has been looking for a complement to Adams for quite a while now, and Lazard has yet to prove he can provide that level of play on a consistent basis. Even against a shaky Vikings secondary, he's best kept on the bench for Week 1.","Washington didn't have much going its way, with or without the ball last season. They'll be expected to lose to the Eagles on their home turf in Week 1. This unit scored in the negatives more times than it reached double-digits in 2019. It's best to leave this D/ST on waivers.","Trubisky appears to be set to start for the Bears in Week 1, despite the arrival of Nick Foles. However, it would be unwise to trust either signal-caller in Chicago this season, as it's unlikely either is going to provide a ton of fantasy value and we may well see both under center from time to time. The Lions provide a great matchup for quarterbacks but, in Week 1, you've certainly got better options.","Kentucky's all-time leading rusher reportedly enjoyed a strong camp with the Steelers this summer, positioning him as the key early-down understudy to James Conner heading into the season. Not expected to handle much work against the Giants to open the campaign, Snell Jr. is merely a deep-league insurance policy. ","Smith has found his way to the end zone 10 times over his first two seasons, but has otherwise lacked the volume necessary to be a consistent fantasy option. With Emmanuel Sanders joining the Saints, Smith is locked into a tertiary role and shouldn't be on your radar for fantasy at this time."],"2":["As steady and productive as any skill player of the past five years, Kelce's rewarding claim of offensive bandwidth on the Chiefs drives consistent value. The Chargers are among the better secondaries in football, but are notably missing Derwin James for what is still a positive matchup for Kelce this week.","Kittle picked up right where he left off as a key member of the San Francisco passing game before leaving with a knee injury in Week 1. If he's healthy enough to play, lock him into your Week 2 lineups against the Jets. Just be sure to keep a close eye on those injury reports.",null,null,"Metcalf and Tyler Lockett both saw eight targets in Week 1. If Russell Wilson can keep both players involved in the passing game this season, fantasy managers can trust in both to delvier solid points totals each week. Metcalf is a bigger red-zone threat but still has big play potential, as he demonstrated in Week 1. Even in a tough matchup with New England in Week 2, he's a must start as a WR2/flex.","A slow start led to another stronger overall outing for this elite defensive group, as Pittsburgh held the Giants to just 24 net rushing yards while hitting their backs were hit 1.3 yards behind the line of scrimmage on average. The Steelers also led the league in blitzes and pressures in Week 1, setting up a strong Week 2 showing against a young Denver offense.","Ryan Fitzpatrick was a turnover machine last week against the Patriots, meanwhile Buffalo was third in the league last week in blitz rate. With Buffalo's aggressive and talented defense, this D/ST can be considered a top unit for Week 2. ","Wentz was on-target early, staking the Eagles to a 17-0 lead in Week 1. However, after that start, Washington dialed up the pass rush and Wentz struggled, finishing with just 270 yards in the air and a pair of scores to go along with two picks. Week 2 presents a matchup with a Rams defense that has the ability to pressure the passer, but is not as solid as Washington in other areas. With a week for Philadelphia to work on pass protection, Wentz should be considered as a borderline QB1 this time around.","Mattison looked sharp in limited playing time in Week 1, chipping in 80 total yards on 10 touches. However, he played on only 19 snaps and will always finish behind Dalvin Cook for meaningful opportunities in this Vikings offense. He's a great backup plan for those who roster Cook, but he shouldnt be started until there is a depth-chart shakeup.","A series of acrobatic catches and a team-high rate of targets per route are positive outcomes from his first game working with Tyrod Taylor. With an average depth of target nearly 16 yards down the field in Week 1, Williams profiles as a worthy boom-or-bust flex against the Chiefs. ","Lazard appears to be locked in as the No. 2 receiver for Green Bay, seeing playing time on almost every snap and representing one of only three wideouts to see the field for more than one play in the game. He turned in a solid outing, hauling in a touchdown and catching every one of his targets. Ultimately, though, four targets will not be enough for automatic inclusion in your fantasy lineup. Keep an eye on him, but he's best left on the bench for Week 2. ","Last season, Washington's defense was one of the poorest in the league. Despite an inspired performance in the opener featuring a dialed-up pass rush, it's best to take the wait-and-see approach here and look elsewhere for your Week 2 D/ST.","Trubisky was solid  in Week 1, tossing three touchdown passes and avoiding turnovers against the Lions. This week, he will face a similarly poor Giants pass defense, so we can probably expect more of the same. Trubisky isn't the safest option by any means, but if you're rotating quarterbacks from the waiver wire on a weekly basis, he's among the top options against a squad that allowed the fourth-most points to passers last season.","The Steelers ran on the vast majority of Snell's snaps once James Conner went down early with an ankle injury in Week 1. A busy early-down role led to Snell producing a career-high in rushing. If Conner is out this week against the Broncos, a team that just struggled to contain the Titans, Snell makes for a great plug-and-play.","With the Saints gameplan focusing on short passes, there wasnâ€™t much for Smith to do in Week 1. He ended up catching one ball on only four targets despite playing on 44 snaps. In general, this will be the case, though Smith could see more attention with Michael Thomas likely to be missing for several weeks due to a high-ankle sprain. If Thomas is on your roster, consider grabbing Smith this week."],"3":["Leading the Chiefs with 20 targets and 15 receptions through two outings, Kelce also leads the team in target percentage per route run at a robust 27.4%, confirming how integral he's become to this elite offense. The Ravens have actually struggled a bit against tight ends to begin the season in allowing the sixth-most yards to the position through two weeks.","Kittle is aiming to return from injury in Week 3, but that might be a bit ambitious. Jordan Reed filled in for him quite nicely in Week 2, which might help the 49ers slow down what could be a rushed return to action from their superstar tight end. If he's healthy, he's a must-start as always. Just keep an eye on his health heading into Sunday's matchup.",null,null,"Metcalf has hauled in four passes and gone over 90 yards while finding the end zone in both games to begin the season. This consistency is a huge plus from the big-play-capable sophomore and, with Russell Wilson playing so well, he should remain a fixture in fantasy lineups for weeks to come. He's a solid WR2 pick against a Dallas defense that couldn't keep up with the Falcons' passing game in Week 2.","The Steelers have now tallied at least one sack on defense in 59 straight games, tying the-longest streak by any team since 1970. The Texans, meanwhile, have allowed the fifth-highest pressure rate to opponents this season.","The Bills have a deep defense that relies on the blitz often to create pressure. The Rams have a deep offense that relies on misdirection and play-action to create paths. In a solid matchup for Buffalo, this D/ST is merely in the streaming tier given the riskier opponent.","In a season with some early outstanding performances at the position, Wentz has been a disappointment among quarterbacks, though he's faced a pair of good defenses in Washington and the Rams. Week 3 against the soft Bengals defense looks to be easier, at least on paper, although it lines up better on the ground than through the air. Wentz is better than his stats indicate, but it's prudent to wait for a weaker pass defense before entrusting your fantasy fate to the Eagles signal-caller.","Mattison took a step back in playing time and touches in Week 2 as the Vikings stumbled through a poor game on offense. Any hopes that Mattison might become a viable starter alongside Dalvin Cook need to be set aside for the moment. He's best left on benches as a backup plan should anything happen to Cook.","A gifted 50/50 ball threat, Williams is likely better off from a fantasy perspective if Justin Herbert takes over the offense. Even with Tyrod Taylor behind center, however, Williams merits interest from fantasy managers thanks to a choice matchup with some exploitable outside corners for Carolina.","Lazard led the Packers in snaps at receiver with Davante Adams spending a good amount of time on the sidelines with a hamstring injury. Unfortunately, he still saw only five passes thrown his way, just three of which were caught. He's failed to deliver many big performances even when handed increased playing time. As such, even with Adams potentially out in Week 3, he'd be a risky flex pick. If Adams plays, Lazard is not a name to consider at all for your fantasy lineup.","It's strength versus strength as the staunch Washington run defense will be tasked with containing the Browns two-headed monster of Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt. Matchups of this ilk rarely result in D/ST fantasy points so it's best to leave the Washington unit on the sidelines.","The yards certainly haven't been there, but Trubisky has delivered five touchdowns over the first two weeks of the season. It might be tempting to consider him for your fantasy lineup against an Atlanta team that's allowed the most QB fantasy points so far this season, but don't lock him into your lineup without considering your alternatives. He's a viable starter, but with a low ceiling due to his lack of yardage and rushing upside.","Four touches and a single scrimmage yard was the result for Snell with James Conner dominating work in Week 2. While still a worthy insurance option, Snell isn't a viable play now that Conner is back in the mix for this meeting with a leaky Houston defense.","Smith was the lone wideout to pick up the slack with Michael Thomas sidelined, catching five balls on seven targets for 86 yards. Week 3 presents a favorable matchup against a Packers secondary that has already been victimized by four TD passes. Even so, Smith's production isn't consistent enough to be considered for an active fantasy roster spot."],"4":["It's incredible that a somewhat quiet week for Kelce includes 87 yards, but such is the high bar for the top tight end in fantasy. With the Patriots allowing the fifth-fewest fantasy points to tight ends, there is some added risk in this matchup, but Kelce's awesome workload sustains must-start value.","Kittle is one of many injured San Francisco skill-position players to keep an eye on this week. If he's healthy, he belongs in your fantasy lineup as one of the best players at his position in the league. Base your lineup decision solely on his playing status and injury reports.",null,null,"Metcalf has been a big-play machine this season, hauling in only four passes in each contest thus far, but averaging over 23 yards per reception. There's a bit of boom-or-bust scenario in place here, but with Russell Wilson playing at an MVP level under center, the \"boom\" chance is much higher. Lock him in as a solid WR2 in all formats against a Miami defense allowing the 11th-most points to opposing wideouts this season.","This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","The Buffalo defense seems to live on pressure, as they've created the fifth-most pressures in the NFL this season. The Raiders, however, have allowed pressure on just 22.1% of dropbacks, the 10th-lowest clip in football. In the end, it's not an ideal matchup for this D/ST with the Raiders' protection rate proving less inviting.  ","Drafted by many as their starting quarterback, Wentz has been a fantasy disappointment. After three weeks of play, he barely makes the top-20 at the position . With a better supporting cast and more experience, Wentz should be able to take better advantage of an injury-depleted San Francisco defense than Giants quarterback Daniel Jones did last week. Even so, until he displays a consistently higher level of performance, Wentz should stay on the fantasy sidelines.","Mattison picked up a solid eight carries off the bench in Week 3, but still remains more of a backup plan for Dalvin Cook than a standalone fantasy option. He should remain on the bench for Week 4.","Held to just 21 routes due to a hamstring injury, Williams isn't a bankable fantasy factor even if healthy facing a Buccaneers defense that has had some early success defending receivers. Williams is dependent on securing 50/50 balls down the field, so his injury and the tougher matchup blend to keep him off the starting radar.","Stepping up for the injured Davante Adams, Lazard had a breakout effort in Week 3, hauling in 6-of-8 targets for 146 yards and a score. Unfortunately, he underwent core muscle surgery earlier this week and may not be on the field again for at least six weeks. ","Look for Baltimore's Lamar Jackson to rebound from Monday night's subpar effort against the Chiefs in this Sunday's date with Washington. While this D/ST is sometimes in play as a streaming option, this isn't one of those instances.",null,"This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","Smith's forte is getting downfield, which is counter to Drew Brees' proclivity for the short game. With Michael Thomas sidelined, Smith hauled in four throws last week, but he's not likely to see the consistent volume needed to be a regular fantasy

enters the 2020 season attempting to pace all tight ends in fantasy points for the fifth consecutive season. Is that good? It seems good. Kelce continued his dominance last season by finishing as a top-13 fantasy TE every week other than 17. Kelce has finished no lower than second at the position in routes, targets, receptions and yardage each of the past three seasons. His touchdowns fell from 10 in 2018 to five in 2019, but his 7.3 OTD (second-highest) and nine end zone targets (fourth) suggest he was actually unlucky in that area. Kelce has never finished a season outside the top 10 in YPT and remains one of Patrick Mahomes' top targets. The 30-year-old is worth a look in Round 2.","Kittle wasn't much of a factor as a pass-catcher during the 49ers' Super Bowl run (8-71-0 in three games), but don't let that overshadow what was another dominant regular season. Kittle followed up his breakout 2018 season with an 85-1053-5 receiving line in 14 games in 2019. Kittle has finished no lower than fourth in targets, receptions, yardage, RAC or fantasy points each of the past two seasons. One area where Kittle has underwhelmed is touchdowns (five each of the past two seasons) and his 10.8 OTD and 13 end zone targets during the span suggest it's not a fluke. Of course, there's still plenty of room to grow in that department, and Kittle has plenty of dominant years left at age 26. He's a fine third-round target.","It doesn't get much more volatile than kickers in fantasy football, but Tucker remains one of the exceptions. The opera-singing superstar has finished no lower than 11th in fantasy points during his eight seasons in the league, which includes four-consecutive top-four finishes. He has accomplished that even with the Ravens ranking 20th in field goal attempts last season (the team's first finish lower than 12th since 2010), though they were first in extra point attempts. Tucker has nailed a league-best 91.3% (168 of 184) of his field goals and a league-best 98.4% (188 of 191) of extra points since 2015. The league's best kicker working in a high-scoring offense, Tucker should be the first kicker drafted.","Butker earned the nickname 'Butt kicker' from his coach Andy Reid during a rookie season in which he finished seventh at the position in fantasy points. He progressed to fifth place in 2018 before pacing the position in total fantasy points and top-10 weeks (11) last season. Butler led the NFL in both attempts (38) and conversions (34) in 2019. In fact, the Chiefs have finished top-nine in field goal attempts in four of the past five seasons. Kansas City's elite offense should help Butker sustain top-end fantasy production.","Metcalf is entering his second NFL season, following an impressive rookie campaign in which he played on 83% of Seattle's snaps and was responsible for 30% of the team's air yards. Metcalf scored seven touchdowns, but was actually unlucky in that department (8.1 OTD), as the Ole Miss product paced the entire NFL in end-zone targets -- his 19 looks were three more than any other player. Metcalf ended the season as fantasy's No. 33 WR, though his role resulted in only one top-12 fantasy week and seven finishes of 40th or worse. Metcalf is only 22 and good bet for a step forward in his second season. Consider him as a WR3 with the upside for a major breakout.","Following a rough start to the 2019 season, Pittsburgh's D/ST went on to finish second in fantasy points, marking the unit's fourth top-eight finish over the past five seasons. Pittsburgh was a big-play machine, ranking no worse than fifth in forced turnovers, yardage allowed and points allowed, as well as first in sacks for the third consecutive season. Other than Javon Hargrave, the entire 2019 defensive core is set to return for 2020. The likes of T.J. Watt, Cameron Heyward and Minkah Fitzpatrick provide this unit with plenty of star power, and youngsters Devin Bush and Terrell Edmunds could add to it this season. The Steelers' D/ST should be one of the first off the board during your draft.","Yet another strong performance from Sean McDermott's defense helped the Bills' D/ST to a second-consecutive top-seven fantasy season in 2019. Buffalo ranked no worse than eighth in interceptions, forced fumbles and points allowed, and was top-three in yardage allowed for the second consecutive season. While Lorenzo Alexander (retirement) will be missed, the Buffalo defense is arguably better after adding Quinton Jefferson, Mario Addison and Josh Norman. Led by the likes of Tre'Davious White, Jordan Poyer, Micah Hyde, Jerry Hughes and emerging youngsters Ed Oliver and Tremaine Edmunds, the Bills' D/ST is arguably your best option in fantasy.","Despite his wide receiver room being absolutely ravaged by injuries, Wentz posted his second career top-10 fantasy campaign in 2019. Volume was the primary reason, as the 27-year-old ranked first in snaps, fifth in pass attempts and seventh in carries among QBs. Wentz dealt with 24 drops (third most) and got very little after the catch for the fourth consecutive season (4.8 RAC). Perhaps most important, Wentz held up, handling 99% of the Eagles' dropbacks before a concussion suffered in the playoffs. Wentz will work behind an elite offensive line and with a solid group of weapons in 2020. He's a back-end QB1.","Mattison enters his second NFL season in the same position he was in as a rookie: Dalvin Cook insurance. The 2019 third-round pick impressed in his first season, producing 544 yards on 110 touches. Mattison averaged 4.6 YPC despite facing an average of 7.3 in-box defenders, highest in the NFL. Mattison is entering his age-22 season without much stand-alone value, but there's no doubt that he would vault to RB1 territory in the event of a Dalvin Cook injury in Minnesota's run-heavy scheme. Draft him, and stash him.","Slowly but surely, Williams' pro career continues to progress. The 2017 first-round pick barely played as a rookie, posting a 43-664-10 receiving line in a situational role in 2018. He followed that up with a 49-1,001-2 line as a full-time player in 2019. Last season, Williams paced the NFL in aDOT (17.3) and YPR (20.4) and ranked fourth in YPT (11.0), but dealt with the worst luck in the league in the touchdown department. Williams posted a 6.9 OTD thanks to 11 end-zone targets (tied for eighth most), but scored only twice. The 25-year-old is a strong bet for more touchdowns, but the departure of Philip Rivers hurts his stock. Williams is a more appealing flex choice in non-PPR leagues.","The Packers did surprisingly little to address a shaky WR situation behind Davante Adams during the offseason, which positions Lazard very well for a sizable 2020 role. The undrafted 2018 free agent first saw extended action in Week 6 last season and went on to average 4.8 targets the rest of the way. That allowed a 35-477-3 receiving line and the 51st-most fantasy points among receivers. Green Bay is expected to lean more on the run this season, but Lazard will only need to fend off the likes of Jake Kumerow and Marquez Valdes-Scantling for snaps. Consider Lazard only in very deep leagues.","","Trubisky is technically atop the Bears' depth chart, but he is no longer assured of Week 1 starting duties following the team's acquisition of Nick Foles. The second overall pick in 2017, Trubisky took a step forward in his second pro season back in 2018 but regressed in nearly every category last season. Despite appearing in 15 games, Trubisky was limited to only three top-10 fantasy weeks and finished 26th in points by season's end. The 25-year-old is barely worth QB2 consideration as a starter, so with Foles lingering, he's obviously well off the fantasy

It helps the rookie's case as a RB1 candidate that Houston allowed the 10th-most fantasy points and 12th-most rushing yards to backfields last season.","With an astounding 76 passing scores in 31 career games, Mahomes is tied with Dan Marino for the most touchdowns through as many games in NFL history. Having orchestrated an incredible comeback against the Texans in last season's playoffs, Mahomes is familiar with dropping big numbers on this shaky Houston pass defense.","Moore had a breakout campaign in 2019, going over 1,100 yards on the year and finding himself as Carolina's top option on offense outside of superstar RB Christian McCaffrey. With Teddy Bridgewater now under center, things certainly won't get any worse for Moore, who saw 135 targets in 2019 and will likely see even more in 2020. He's an easy start as your WR1/WR2 in Week 1 against Las Vegas.","Coach Mike Tomlin told reporters several times this offseason he remains a staunch proponent of leaning on a single featured back versus a committee approach. A steady presence as a three-down threat leads to Conner entering Week 1 with awesome fantasy potential facing a leaky Giants front seven.","Working with a proven veteran quarterback should help Hilton's production pattern. Philip Rivers was able to feed Keenan Allen with consistently valuable looks, aiding Hilton's case to return to WR2 value in what is a sweet opening matchup against a porous Jacksonville pass defense.","Without much competition for valuable vertical or red zone looks in this Jacksonville offense, Chark enters his third season with both a stable floor and a fun fantasy ceiling. The Colts were respectable against the pass last season, but Chark's rewarding role keeps him firmly in the WR3 tier with upside for more.","A high-floor receiving threat given how much of his workload comes on high-percentage, short-area targets, Boyd enters the new season working with a talented young quarterback going up against a stingy Chargers pass defense. Given the difficult opponent, expectations are tempered for this flex option.","Pacing the Patriots by 62 targets last season, Edelman should again prove busy as the top option for the New England passing attack this season. The key difference, of course, is the swap of Tom Brady for Cam Newton behind center, lowering both Edelman's fantasy floor and ceiling in the process. The Dolphins have two capable cover corners after investing in the position over the offseason, but sheer volume of opportunities keeps Edelman in the WR2 discussion.","Once buried behind Mark Andrews in Baltimore, Hurst will now step into the shoes of one of the more prolific tight ends in football (Austin Hooper, who left Atlanta to join the Browns). That leaves the 27-year-old Hurst at the top of the depth chart, and he's shown flashes of the kind of production you want to see out of a solid TE1 in fantasy (30 catches on 39 targets and a pair of scores in 2019). He's a bit too unproven relative to other options for Week 1 purposes, but definitely keep an eye on him.",null,"Garoppolo led the San Francisco offense effectively in his first full season as a starter, but he lacked in fantasy upside given the run-first nature of the team and bit of a turnover problem. He enters 2020 as a bit of a \"matchup play\" with upside for a big game every now and then. That said, even against the team that allowed the most QB fantasy points last season (Arizona), he's hard to trust with a starting spot in Week 1.","Fitzgerald has not missed a game since 2014 and, while he is definitely at the tail-end of his career, he's more than good enough to deserve a look in your fantasy lineup every now and then. That said, the 49ers are a middling matchup for opposing wideouts and Fitzgerald has plenty of competition for catches in Week 1 if everyone is healthy. As such, he's best left on the bench for this one.","Brown handled a decent number of carries last season helping to spell the ailing Todd Gurley II, and now he'll do the same for rookie Cam Akers as he adjusts to the league. It remains to be seen if the Rams will hand the keys to the backfield straight to Akers, or if Brown will get a shot to show what he can do. Still, without a proven track record of success and considering the draft capital invested in Akers, we'd say Brown should be kept on the bench for Week 1 against Dallas.","Watkins opened the 2019 season with an incredible performance only to finish with yet another lackluster overall line. The tantalizing upside is still present given his role in a fun offense and this inviting matchup with Houston, but there is also clear risk in deploying Watkins in lineups to open the season.","In last season's home contest against Arizona, the 49ers D/ST scored a touchdown, secured two fumbles and picked up four sacks. That was a fairly typical week for the unit for the first half of the year, but things definitely dipped toward the end of the season. Either way, this is a good matchup for what should be a solid D/ST all season long."],"2":["Just the third player in Chiefs history with as many as 100 rushing yards in his NFL debut, joining Kareem Hunt and Christian Okoye, Edwards-Helaire impressively broke seven tackles on 25 rushes and netted 4.2 yards after initial contact per touch. If the receiving usage shows up -- and it likely will -- Helaire is poised to sustain RB1 value heading into a meeting with a Chargers defense that claims a retooled linebacking corps.","In becoming the fist player in NFL history with three passing scores and no picks in three consecutive season openers, Mahome moved to 8-0 in his career in September as the Chiefs won their 10th straight game. Per this week's matchup, last season, the Chargers played zone at a league-high 68% of opponent dropbacks. Mahomes, meanwhile, ranked tops in the league in QBR facing zone last season.","Mooreâ€™s first week with Teddy Bridgewater under center was uneventful, as he caught just four balls on nine targets, for a modest 54 yards. Against an inexperienced Raiders secondary, Teddy Bridgewater was able to spread things around. The Panthers face another young set of defensive backs in Week 2, though the Buccaneers held Drew Brees to just 160 yards in the air. Moore should improve on last weekâ€™s output, remaining a borderline fantasy WR1.","James Conner left with an ankle injury in the second quarter and never returned to the field. Dubbed the clear every-down back to start the game, Conner would cede most of his touches to Benny Snell if he misses this outing against the Broncos. If active, there is real potential for a solid showing based on volume alone.","Rookie corner C.J. Henderson gave Hilton some trouble in Week 1, leaving Parris Campbell with the most promising usage profile in the opener. There is still very real potential for Hilton to deliver strong results given an expectation for a 20% target share  against a Vikings defense that could struggle in coverage.","You probably sing his name to the Baby Shark melody over and over, don't you? No matter how you celebrate managing Mr. Chark, it was nice to see him pace the Jaguars by a good margin in routes in Week 1. This week offers some real upside given the Titans' biggest weakness on defense is arguably at outside corner. ","With fewer than 40 total air yards and just five targets in Week 1, a tough matchup and Joe Burrow's rookie struggles combined to deliver a weak opener for Boyd. With a friendlier matchup next, Boyd's in a more promising position to produce flex-worthy results.","It's nearly a victory for Edelman to have grinded out 57 yards in his first game working with Cam Newton, as there were only 19 dropbacks in the contest for New England. A chain-moving force for the Patriots, Edelman should sustain value from a flex spot for fantasy managers ahead of an inviting matchup with the Seattle secondary.","Hurst's first game with his new team was mediocre, as he only saw five targets and three receptions. He should be more involved in Week 2 as the Cowboys defense allowed a league-leading 104 catches to tight ends last season, though Dallas held the tight ends on the Rams to just four catches in Week 1. Hurst is in play Week 2 for leagues with 12-plus teams.",null,"Garoppolo's trademark 2019 efficiency was lacking in Week 1 against the Cardinals, as he completed only 57.6% of his passes to open the season. The San Francisco quarterback is tough to trust in fantasy, given the team's run-first nature. However, that's even more true if he's not being as efficient as possible. Keep him sidelined in fantasy for Week 2.","Through one week, it's apparent that the veteran receiver isn't going anywhere. He finished with the second-most receptions among Cardinals in Week 1, and now takes on a much weaker defense in Week 2. Washington might have surprised folks in Week 1, but this is a team that allowed an above-average amount of points to wideouts last season. Fitzgerald is a low-ceiling flex pick in deeper leagues for as long as he's a regular part of this Arizona offense.","Brown had a fantastic 2020 debut as the full-time starter for the Rams, touching the ball 21 times, scoring twice and going over 100 total yards. His days as a part-time backup to Todd Gurley II are over, and he doesn't seem ready to cede his playing time to the backups. He's a solid option as your RB2 heading into Week 2 against the Eagles, who may have a solid run defense, but did allow a pair of rushing touchdowns in Week 1.","Watkins led the Chiefs in targets in what was a quick-hitting, if not vertical, game plan for the Kansas City passing scheme. It's unlikely Watkins will claim such a robust target clip, and a tough matchup with the capable Chargers corners results in risky fantasy stock.","The 49ers have one of the more talented defenses in the league and were among the top D/ST options in 2019, but they struggled out of the gate against an upgraded Arizona offense. A matchup with the Jets should set things right, so you can trust in San Francisco as your D/ST for Week 2."],"3":["A sluggish day on the ground was countered by increased involvement in the Chiefs' passing game for the gifted rookie this past week. The Ravens have been solid against backs in both phases, but sheer volume and potential for valuable touches supports RB1 status for the hyped hyphenated rookie.","For those of you in leagues that track player speed, it helps to note that Mahomes was running at a speed of 11.2 MPH and threw the ball 52.9 yards of air distance (point of throw to catch) on his 54-yard TD to Tyreek Hill in Week 2. Mahomes also added six scrambles for 54 yards and four first downs, matching a career high for rushing first downs in a game. The magical signal-caller might need to flash more tricks against Baltimore's capable defense this Monday.","After a lackluster opening week, Moore garnered 120 yards on eight catches (13 targets). While his 29% target share is encouraging, Moore's 55% catch rate suggests he and Teddy Bridgewater have some timing issues. Moore now faces a Chargers secondary that kept the prolific Chiefs offense in check until late in last week's game. Still, he should receive ample looks to be a solid WR2 in Week 3.","Entering the week there was doubt about whether Conner was still the leading force in this Pittsburgh backfield. Eighteen touches and 121 scrimmage yards later, it's clear that Conner is still the main man for the Steelers heading into this choice matchup with the Texans' porous rush defense. ","A catch rate of just 50% is likely due to the fact Hilton is averaging a robust 14.3 air yards per target. Due for a positive correction in production given healthy opportunity rates through two weeks, Hilton is positioned for a solid showing against a Jets defense allowing 36 fantasy points per game to receivers.","While it would have been nice to see Chark net more than four targets in Week 2, it remains encouraging that he's getting dealt the ball down the field, as his average depth of target of 17.3 yards led the team this past Sunday. As the team's best vertical playmaker, Chark enters this matchup with Miami as a solid flex candidate in all formats.","A return to his steady ways was refreshing for investors, as Boyd delivered a solid line in the loss to the Browns. The Eagles have struggled to contain slot receivers this season, aiding Boyd's upside.","An awesome aDOT (averaged depth of target) of 15.8 yards led to a career yardage showing from Edelman. The transition from Tom Brady to Cam Newton hasn't ruined Edelman's fantasy stock, if anything his ceiling is higher heading into this meeting with an exploitable Raiders pass defense.","After an opening week where Hurst was mainly a safety valve, the former Raven was more involved in Week 2, with several downfield looks (including a 42-yard reception) among his five grabs. Hurst could be in line for another productive week as the opposing Bears clamp down on wideouts but have been more generous to tight ends, surrendering 13 catches for 120 yards in two games. With so many other options, Hurst's upside is capped. Still, his volume keeps him as a streaming candidate.",null,"It seems unlikely that Garoppolo will play in Week 2 after suffering a high-ankle sprain. Even if he does recover, he's not a reliable fantasy starter anyway. Look elsewhere for your Week 3 quarterback.","The veteran receiver made a bit of a splash in Week 2, hauling in seven passes and playing on a healthy 61 snaps on offense. Yet, with DeAndre Hopkins leading Arizona's pass-catching corps and Kyler Murray providing production with his running, Fitzgerald and teammate Christian Kirk are left to split a small share of the Cardinals offense. Neither is a great option this week, but in a great matchup with the Lions, they can both be  considered as low-end flex picks.","Injuries will impact the Rams backfield in Week 3, as Brown is dealing with a broken finger and Cam Akers has separated rib cartilage. With both players dealing with ailments over the weekend, Darrell Henderson Jr. stepped up and had a huge game -- after previously seeming like the clear No. 3 man on the RB depth chart. Brown still appears to be the starter, but the combination of a minor injury and the performance of Henderson means he's a very risky flex play, at best, in Week 3 against the Bills.","Down to just three targets and 22 air yards in Week 2 after netting nine looks and roughly 100 air yards in Week 1, Watkins isn't a weekly threat to produce helpful numbers, but rather a boom-or-bust option ideal for DFS or deeper leagues. Baltimore has been solid in allowing the fewest fantasy points to receivers among AFC teams this season, further limiting the appeal with Watkins.","After a tough Week 1 against a very talented Arizona offense, the 49ers settled in with a solid showing against the Jets in Week 2. Expect more of the same as they stay in the Meadowlands for a matchup with the Giants. You can safely start this unit as your D/ST in all leagues."],"4":["With 25 touches in yet another outings, this rare rookie has a firm grip on work as both a rusher and a receiver in the league's most dangerous offense. The Patriots have weakened against the run compared to last season and have yielded 100 rushing yards per game to tailbacks thus far. With Edwards-Helaire consuming so many touches each week, it's easy to start him in all formats.","Now with two Monday Night Football games with at least five total touchdowns, Mahomes next looks to take down the Patriots. The New England pass defense isn't nearly as stingy this season compared to last season's rates, while Mahomes' incomparable scoring upside keeps him in the must-start tier of passers.","Week 3 was a quiet one as Teddy Bridgewater put the ball in the air only 28 times, four of which went Moore's way. He reeled in two balls for a team-high 65 yards. Moore draws the Cardinals in Week 4, a top-10 pass defense through three weeks. Even so, Moore remains one of Bridgewater's favorite targets, so he's still a solid WR2.","This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","Now up to 14 straight games with fewer than 100 receiving yards dating back to 2018, the longest such stretch of his career, Hilton also now has eight straight games without a touchdown. Due for some bigger plays given his blend of routes and air yards, Hilton faces a Chicago secondary allowing the ninth-most yards per game to wideouts. ","Still dealing with chest and back ailments, Chark would emerge as a solid WR2 candidate against an exploitable tandem of corners for Cincinnati. If he's ready to go, Chark's blend of downfield usage and solid matchup helps his case as a fantasy starter.","A gaudy 13 targets fueled a big Week 3 showing in South Philly for Boyd, as the Pitt product netted 10 catches in a strong showing. The Jaguars have some issues in coverage from the slot, which aids Boyd's relatively stable floor and his case as a high-end WR2 candidate.","While he didn't have any success connecting with Cam Newton after a career outing in Week 2, it's helpful to note Edelman's average depth of target remained healthy at 12.1 air yards in Week 3. Per this upcoming AFC showdown, the Chiefs have been outright stingy against receivers, but Edelman's steady slice of the passing game helps support WR2 expectations.","The good news is that Hurst appears to be a regular red-zone target for Matt Ryan, securing TD catches in each of the last two weeks. However, Sunday's score was the only pass sent in Hurst's direction. Another quiet game is possible as the Packers are allowing fewer than four catches (and for under 50 yards a game) to tight ends. Still, with the potential for Hurst to find paydirt, he's still worth a flier in most leagues.",null,"Even if Garoppolo is able to return to action in Week 4 against the Eagles, it's hard to trust him as your starter in fantasy. He has his moments of brilliance, but too often San Francisco leans quite heavily on the running game and does not allow Garoppolo to rack up the fantasy points. The Eagles have allowed the 11th-fewest QB fantasy points this season, so you can avoid this situation altogether in favor of better matchups.","In Week 3, Fitzgerald did not see a boost in opportunities with Christian Kirk out. In fact, his targets actually decreased against the Lions. That's not a great sign heading into Week 4, when we'd want to see the veteran poised for a heavy workload to merit a start against a middle-of-the-pack Carolina defense. Keep him on the bench for now.","Brown played on as many snaps as Darrell Henderson Jr. in Week 3, but Henderson saw the bulk of the touches, leaving the more experienced back as the No. 2 option. The Giants provide a decent matchup for opposing backs, but it is Henderson, and not Brown,who is the Los Angeles \"back to look to\" in fantasy for Week 4.","In the two weeks Watkins has played a full game, he's netted 17 targets and proven integral to the offense. The Patriots haven't been elite against the pass just yet, but have deep personnel in the secondary and make for a difficult matchup. It's safe to assume Watkins is just outside flex territory for now.","After a slow start to the season against a Cardinals offense that has given them issues in the past, the 49ers are back to their dominant ways as a D/ST.

is in running back paradise after Andy Reid and the Chiefs selected him with the 32nd pick of April's draft. The LSU product isn't particularly fast (4.60 40-yard dash) and is on the small side at 5-foot-7, 207 pounds, but he sports elite elusiveness and tackle-breaking ability. Edwards-Helaire also paced this year's rookie class in targets (65), receptions (55) and receiving yards (453) last season. He has three-down upside, though it's possible his frame could cost him goal-line touches.  Edwards-Helaire's short-term production got a big boost when potential counterpart Damien Williams opted out for the season, which positions the rookie as the clear feature back in the Chiefs' high-scoring, Patrick Mahomes-led offense. He's immediately in the RB1 mix.","Patrick Mahomes is 24 years old and has 36 NFL starts under his belt yet has already been named both league and Super Bowl MVP. So where does he go from here? Well, considering he still has Andy Reid's pass-heavy scheme, a strong offensive line and a terrific group of targets led by Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce at his disposal, we should probably expect more of the same. Granted, Mahomes returned to earth a bit last season (4,031 passing yards, 28 total TDs) after his breakout 2018 campaign (5,097 yards, 52 TDs), but he was still unquestionably one of the best players in the league. Mahomes was fantasy's No. 3 scoring QB during the 13 weeks he played in full, and that doesn't even count his 12 touchdowns in three playoff games. Mahomes remains an elite fantasy option.","The first wide receiver selected in the 2018 draft, Moore flashed with a 55-788-2 receiving line as a rookie before enjoying a full-on breakout in 2019. Moore finished as a top-10 WR in routes, targets, receptions and receiving yards. Moore's efficiency has been outstanding, as he has dropped just three of 215 career targets, while dominating with the ball in his hands (5.7 RAC). The one drawback has been a lack of scoring (six career TDs, 8.2 OTD), which has limited his ceiling. He managed only two weekly finishes better than 13th and was fantasy's No. 16 WR in 2019. Moore will have new QB Teddy Bridgewater and new coach Matt Rhule this season, but the 23-year-old's heavy usage is unlikely to change, though perhaps he'll see more goal-line work. He's a fringe WR1.","Conner returns as the lead back in Pittsburgh, but durability has become a significant concern for a player who has missed at least two games in each of his three NFL seasons. Despite missing three games in 2018, Conner broke out with 1,462 yards and 13 TDs on 269 touches en route to finishing sixth among running backs in fantasy points. He sat ninth at the position through Week 8 last season, but injuries limited him to 54 snaps the rest of the season. A return to full health by Conner and Ben Roethlisberger very well could lead to a bounce-back campaign for the 25-year-old, though he'll need to fend off Benny Snell Jr., Jaylen Samuels and rookie Anthony McFarland Jr. for touches. Consider Conner a flex option.","Hilton enters 2020 looking for a rebound following what was essentially a lost season. As if Andrew Luck's shocking August retirement wasn't enough, injuries limited Hilton to only 10 games and a situational role in the second half of the campaign. Hilton was still effective when healthy, ranking 13th in fantasy points during the six weeks he was active prior to Week 9. Hilton is now 30 years old, but has generally held up well, missing only four games during his first seven seasons. He will now have Philip Rivers throwing him passes. Hilton was a top-27 fantasy WR during each of his first seven seasons and remains very much in the WR2 discussion for 2020.","Chark entered 2019 with little fanfare, despite the fact that he was a second-round pick entering his second NFL season and positioned for a significant boost in playing time. It didn't take long for the former LSU star to get noticed. Despite Jacksonville's offensive dysfunction, Chark posted a 73-1,008-8 receiving line. His 12 end-zone targets (over 15 contests) tied for fifth most in the league and only 16 receivers scored more fantasy points. Chark is 23 years old with the size and speed to sustain top-tier production. With Gardner Minshew entering his second season and Jay Gruden perhaps adding a spark to the offense, Chark has the look of a good WR3 with upside.","Boyd seemed like a total bust through his first two seasons in the league, but the Bengals' slot man has completely shed that label with a pair of top-18 fantasy campaigns. With A.J. Green sidelined last season, Boyd finished no lower than eighth among receivers in snaps, routes run, targets and receptions. Weak quarterback play led to underwhelming efficiency numbers, but it's very possible that will improve with No. 1 overall pick Joe Burrow under center. Boyd isn't going to get you many TDs (12 TD, 7.7 OTD, 7 end zone targets over the past two seasons) and his targets will take a slight hit with the combination of Green's return and rookie Tee Higgins joining the fold. Still, the 25-year-old short-area weapon will rack up plenty of catches. Consider Boyd to be a fine WR3 in PPR formats.","Edelman enters his age-34 season fresh off a terrific 2019 campaign in which he finished as a top-five WR in routes, targets, receptions and OTD. He finished the year with a career-best seventh-place finish in fantasy points. Edelman has now finished no worse than 17th in fantasy points per game in each of his past six seasons. Despite all of the success, Edelman's stock is on the decline following Tom Brady's departure. The Patriots' offense is a strong bet for a decrease in passing volume and efficiency and, if that weren't bad enough, Edelman is now 34 and has managed only three career 16-game seasons. Edelman figures to remain prominently targeted, but is now best viewed as a WR3 with limited upside.","Hurst was traded to the Falcons following two seasons as a situational player in Baltimore. Atlanta will look to the 2018 first-round pick as a replacement for Austin Hooper. Hurst posted a modest 30-349-2 receiving line off the bench last season, but his efficiency was great. He ranked sixth at tight end in both catch rate (77%) and YPT (8.9). Hurst has yet to eclipse a 58% snap share in 30 career games, but he figures to operate as a full-time, two-way tight end in a pass-heavy Atlanta offense that helped Hooper to back-to-back TE1 campaigns. Hurst is obviously a bit risky, but the 26-year-old is well-positioned for a breakout. Consider him a mid-range TE2.","Boswell is the epitome of kickers in fantasy football, having finished 22nd or worse twice and 10th or better twice during the past four seasons. That includes a 10th-place finish in 2019 in which the Steelers' kicker managed nine top-10 weeks (fifth most). Boswell didn't miss an extra point and converted on 93.5% of 31 field goal attempts last season, which was third best in the league. Boswell has been an above-average kicker in all four of his healthy NFL seasons and, especially with Ben Roethlisberger back, the 29-year-old can be viewed as a starter in fantasy.","The 49ers were the best team in the NFC last season, but that did not lead to much fantasy relevance for Garoppolo. Appearing in more than six games in a single season for the first time in his career, Garoppolo finished 14th in fantasy points and was held to four top-10 weeks (18 QBs had more). Garoppolo tossed 27 touchdowns (fifth most) and was efficient (69% completion rate, 8.4 YPA), but he lacked opportunity in San Francisco's run-heavy offense (he finished 19th in pass attempts) and added very little with his legs (46-62-1 rushing line). Garoppolo has a good supporting cast led by George Kittle, Deebo Samuel and a great line, but the 28-year-old figures to cap out as a QB2 in Kyle Shanahan's run-heavy scheme.","Fitzgerald is back for his 17th NFL season. Arizona's primary slot receiver put together another solid season in 2019, ranking 17th in the league in receptions (75), while not dropping a single one of his 108 targets. No longer a downfield threat, Fitzgerald has ranked in the 17th percentile or lower in YPR in each of the past five seasons and hasn't cleared six touchdowns since 2015. Fitzgerald's role limited him to just one weekly finish better than 19th last season (ninth in Week 1). Fitzgerald is entering his age-37 season and his targets will take another hit with DeAndre Hopkins now in the fold. Fitzgerald has a very low ceiling and is only an option in very deep PPR leagues.","With Todd Gurley out of the picture in Los Angeles, Brown will compete with second-year Darrell Henderson and rookie Cam Akers for touches in the Rams' backfield. Brown is entering his sixth NFL season having yet to eclipse 69 carries or 11 targets in a campaign. Brown could factor in on early downs and near the goal line (he's 224 pounds and scored five touchdowns last season) but is a long shot for anything more than situational duties and is unlikely to factor in as a receiver. Consider him for your bench in deep leagues.","Watkins enters his seventh NFL season having yet to finish a season better than WR20 in fantasy points and having failed to manage a top-40 fantasy campaign since 2015. Injuries (17 missed games over the past four seasons) and a lack of touchdowns (three or fewer scores in three of the past four seasons) have been a large part of what has held him back, but Watkins also hasn't solidified himself as a consistent, go-to target. Watkins opened 2019 with a dominant 9-198-3 receiving line in Week 1, but didn't score or clear 13 fantasy points in any game the rest of the way. The 26-year-old obviously has some appeal in the Chiefs' high-scoring offense, but there's a good chance he loses work to second-year Mecole Hardman. Watkins is worth no more than a late-round flier.","After four consecutive seasons finishing 29th or worse, the 49ers' D/ST climbed all the way up to third during a breakout 2019. San Francisco ranked no lower than fifth in forced fumbles, sacks, yardage allowed, points allowed and D/ST touchdowns. Trading away arguably their best player in DeForest Buckner is a big loss for the 49ers, but the good news is that the rest of the team's 2019 core remains in place. Nick Bosa, Arik Armstead, Richard Sherman and Jimmie Ward provide the star power, with Kwon Alexander and Dee Ford likely to bring more to the table at full health this season.

Jason Garrett is gone, meaning there could be some changes to the way the Cowboys operate in the huddle, but there's no reason to believe that a back who scored 14 touchdowns a year ago would be shut out of the offense under new leadership. Start him in all leagues in Week 1 against a middling Rams rush defense.","Securing a strong second contract was a coup for Mixon in what has been a difficult market for running back talent in recent seasons. The Oklahoma product will see plenty of work for this opening matchup against a Chargers front that allowed nearly 100 yards per game on the ground to backfields last season.","Golladay took a leap toward elite status in 2019, hauling in 11 touchdowns to more than double his 2018 total. That he did so with fewer overall targets makes the feat even more impressive, as the third-year pro got more efficient and effective in the red zone. With a healthy Matthew Stafford under center, Golladay is a very appealing fantasy option. Even against a tough Bears defense (fourth-fewest WR fantasy points allowed in 2019), he's a solid WR3/flex starter for Week 1.","Much like with his quarterback, the hope is that 2019's disappointing season is an outlier and not a trend for Beckham. Held to just six catches for 64 yards in two meetings with the Ravens last season, Beckham faces a difficult for matchup to begin his second campaign with the Browns. Given an expectation for a good deal of targets in Week 1, Beckham remains a worthy WR2 option.","All Brown did as a rookie was lead the league in yards per target and tie Michael Thomas for the most top-10  fantasy finishes among receivers. Denver lost some talent in the secondary over the offseason, helping Brown's bid to open his second season with a  strong performance. ","The latest in a long line of Georgia running backs to go from Athens to the pros, Swift seems poised to be the Lions' lead back in 2020. He is productive both as a runner and receiver, although his college stats skew toward keeping the ball on the ground. He has been dealing with an undisclosed injury, and both Kerryon Johnson and Adrian Peterson will be competing for carries, so it might be wise to wait a week or two and see exactly where Swift lands on the Lions' RB depth chart before putting him in your fantasy lineup.","Montgomery is dealing with a groin injury and seems unlikely to suit up for the 2020 opener. Even if he does, soft tissue injuries always carry with them a big risk, so tread carefully and consider going with a safer option. That said, the Lions were a great matchup for opposing backs last season, so if Montgomery gets encouraging news ahead of Sunday, he's worth a spot in your Week 1 lineup.",null,"In 2019, Jones had his best fantasy season to date, averaging nearly 15 points per game and finding the end zone quite a bit. However, his scoring came in big, inconsistent chunks -- six of his nine receiving touchdowns came in just two games. He's not quite as consistent as the younger Kenny Golladay, but he's just as capable of a huge stat line. All in all, he's a risky play that's still worthy of being a  flex option against a stout Bears pass defense.","As Sam Darnold's security blanket on high-percentage, short-area targets, this slot maven's value is driven by sheer volume of opportunity. The Bills boast talented defensive backs throughout the secondary, which results in Crowder capping out as a flex option for the opener.","Leonard Fournette, accounted for 30.6% of teamâ€™s 2019 scrimmage yards, while Armstead and Chris Thompson combined forÂ just 246 rushing yards last season. Arguably the top candidate to handle early-down duties now that Fournette is with Tampa Bay, Armstead is a worthy stash to consider ahead of a meeting with a Colts defense that allowed the 10th-fewest rushing yards to backs last season.","A popular sleeper candidate coming off of a lost 2019 season due to suspension and injuries, Herndon flashed a fun rapport with Sam Darnold during the quarterback's rookie campaign. Back at practice after an injury scare last week, Herndon figures to be a busy target, albeit while facing a very difficult matchup with a stingy Buffalo defense.","Seventh among quarterbacks in fantasy points per game in a career revival last season, Tannehill is now the unquestioned signal-caller for the Titans going forward. This is an offense designed to run the ball as a priority and while the Broncos present a challenge given an established tandem of edge rushers for opposing passers, a blend of rushing potential and some exciting young pass-catchers helps Tannehill's case as a streaming option behind center.","The Buccaneers made big strides as a D/ST last season, finishing with 12-plus points in five of their final six games. That was fueled by quite a few touchdowns scored, which aren't particularly reliable, but it was also thanks to some healthy sack and turnover totals. Tampa Bay will travel to New Orleans to kick off the season and, while Drew Brees is not particularly turnover-prone, the Buccaneers could still be worthwhile as a starting D/ST.",null],"2":["Elliottâ€™s Week 1 performance reinforced why he was a top-three pick. He totaled 127 yards from scrimmage while toting the ball into the end zone twice. Week 2 presents a Falcons defense which finished last season on a roll but was shredded by Russell Wilson in Week 1, helping explain the low total of just 84 rushing yards allowed, albeit with a touchdown. Regardless, Elliott is matchup-proof. Start him.","Mixon saw 19 of the Bengals' 20 carries from the team's running backs. A rare, but ugly, fumble proved costly for both Mixon's fantasy stock and the Bengals' chances in Week 1. While a fun passing role might never surface, a featured role against Cleveland's defense supports starting fantasy value. ","Golladay did not play in Week 1 due to a hamstring injury. You'll likely need to keep an eye on his injury status all the way up until kickoff in Week 2. However, if he does suit up, he'll go up against a Green Bay defense that failed to impress in Week 1. Once healthy, he should immediately regain his status as a must-start wideout each and every week in fantasy football.","The film shows Beckham got open at a good rate in Week 1, but skittish play behind center limited him to just 22 receiving yards in Week 1, the second-lowest tally in his career. A bounce-back outing could be on the way against a more exploitable Cincinnati secondary, supporting WR2 expectations for Beckham.","It's tough to deliver WR2 results when the opportunity rates prove so conservative; Brown had just 50 total air yards sent his way. A much easier matchup awaits Brown with the Jaguars this week, thus he remains a strong starting option.","Swift led all Lions backs in playing time in Week 1, but did not lead in touches. That honor went to veteran Adrian Peterson. At this point, it appears likely that Detroit will rotate its running backs in order to try to find the hot hand, leaving them all as very risky plays in fantasy. Swift did find the end zone in his first contest but on only six touches. It's hard to trust him in Week 2 against Green Bay.","Tarik Cohen split snaps at running back with Montgomery but, as we've come to expect, it was Montgomery who saw the bulk of the touches via handoffs. Cohen's looks come more inconsistently, and primarily in the passing game. The second-year back is better in non-PPR leagues, but any player getting 15-plus touches per game is worth a shot in most fantasy leagues. He's a low-end RB2/flex option in Week 2 against a mediocre Giants defense.",null,"Even with Kenny Golladay out, Jones posted fairly pedestrian numbers in Week 1, seeing eight targets while catching only four balls. That said, he is still one of Matthew Stafford's top options and, whether Golladay plays or not, he has high upside due to his ability as a pass-catcher in the red zone. After Week 1, the Green Bay defense doesn't look to be quite as strong against the pass as it did a season ago, so lock Jones into your lineups with confidence.","The lone trusted skill player from a fantasy perspective in the offense heading into Week 2, Crowder paced the team by a wide margin in receiving opportunities this past week. Another volume-driven outing might be necessary against a solid San Francisco defense, with Crowder established as a solid flex candidate in PPR formats.",null,"A nearly 20% target share and a presence on 40 snaps this past week, with nine of them lined up out wide, Herndon's usage profile was pretty solid in the loss. The 49ers have been solid against tight ends for some time, so it could require a deep league or punting the position to stream Herndon in such a matchup.","Still somehow underrated and rostered in a small slice of ESPN leagues relative to his production pattern, Tannehill nearly produced 20 fantasy points against the Broncos in throwing his most pass attempts in a game since Week 2 of the 2016 season. ","Keeping Christian McCaffrey in check is a daunting task, but if the Tampa Bay defense can do so, Teddy Bridgewater may well be forced into mistakes. Week 2 sees the Buccaneers D/ST check in as a streaming option in deeper formats.",null],"3":["While Elliott turned in a workmanlike day on the ground, rushing for 89 yards on 22 carries, the fact that he also caught 6-of-7 targets for another 33 yards is a welcome sight. The extra attention in the Cowboys passing game could come in handy again this week against a Seahawks defense adept at stopping the run while being vulnerable against the pass. Regardless of the opponent, Elliott is a RB1 lock.","A solid day receiving salvaged a sluggish rushing effort for Mixon in Week 2. With Gio Bernard still commanding a significant share of the passing game, Mixon remains a high-end RB2 heading into a meeting with a solid Philadelphia rush defense.","Golladay looks set to make his return in Week 3, but keep an eye on the news and verify his status before locking him into your lineups. A season ago, the Cardinals offered one of the best matchups in football for opposing wideouts, but they've stepped up their game in 2020. Still, Golladay is a solid contributor with big-play potential and should be in your lineup if he's healthy.","A 43-yard score in the second frame of Week 2's win over the Bengals marked Beckham's 14th score of at least 40 yards, tied with Tyreek Hill for the second-most such scores behind just DeSean Jackson since 2014. A bit dependent on breaking a big play to deliver strong fantasy results, at least Beckham can enjoy solid matchups this week against a lackluster Washington secondary.","A bone bruise on his left knee kept Brown off the field for Week 2's win. It's unclear if Brown is able to play this week against the Vikings given his injury. If Brown is active, it's great for his fantasy profile that the Vikings are allowing the second-most fantasy points to receivers.","The Lions appear to be using a true three-man rotation at running back heading into Week 3. In Week 2, it was Kerryon Johnson who saw most of the looks in the red zone. That's a big knock against Swift, who really needs high-value touches given his limited playing time. None of these backs stand out enough to merit a fantasy start, not even against an Arizona defense that has struggled against backs so far this season (fifth-most fantasy points allowed).","Montgomery had one of the best games of his young career in Week 2, racking up 19 touches for over 120 total yards and a touchdown. The fact that he saw three targets (compared to Tarik Cohen's one) is a sign that may indicate Montgomery is developing chemistry with his quarterback and becoming a more well-rounded fantasy option. Against a porous Atlanta defense, he's a solid RB2 pick.",null,"Jones has led the Lions in snaps at wide receiver through two games with Kenny Golladay out and, while that has only turned into eight receptions and 78 yards, the opportunities are certainly there. The targets have been spread a bit thin on this offense, and Kenny Golladay seems likely to return for Week 3, but Jones still stands to play quite a bit against an Arizona team that struggled against receivers last season. Consider him as a WR3/flex pick for this matchup.","A dreaded hamstring injury could keep Crowder from suiting up this week against the Colts. Indianapolis has allowed the fewest yards to receivers this season, with Crowder positioned as a risky flex option if he's able to battle through injury this week. ",null,"It's probably not a good thing that the most noteworthy part of Herndon's performance in Week 2 was a dropped touchdown in the third quarter. Even with the Jets' receiving corps decimated by injury, Herndon didn't capitalize. The Colts, meanwhile, have allowed the fewest fantasy points to tight ends this season.  ","In a fun win over the Jaguars, Tannehill became the first Titans signal-caller since Marcus Mariota in 2016 to deliver four passing touchdowns with zero interceptions. The Vikings are allowing nearly 21 fantasy points per game to opposing passers, aiding Tannehill's case as a worthy streaming candidate.","The strong Buccaneers D/ST checks in as one of the top options this week, despite being on the road in Denver. The Broncos lost QB Drew Lock to injury, so Jeff Driskel will be at the helm. A defense can do a lot in terms of fantasy production in that scenario.",null],"4":["Elliott ran into a buzzsaw as the inspired Seattle defense held him to a paltry 34 yards on 14 carries, along with just 24 receiving yards on six grabs. Thankfully for him, a one-yard scoring plunge salvaged his Week 3 fantasy production. Elliott should benefit from the return of LT Tyron Smith and, therefore, may enjoy more running lanes against the Browns. Last week was just a blip. Elliott should return to top form in Week 4.","Producing a Frank Gore special with just 65 scoreless scrimmage yards despite 19 touches, Mixon saw backfield partner Gio Bernard thrive with 55 yards in the air this past Sunday. A ton of rushing potential this week against a porous Jacksonville front seven helps offset Mixon's weak presence as a receiving threat, setting up RB1 expectations.","Golladay made his 2020 debut in Week 3 and wasted no time reminding us what he can do. He hauled in 6-of-7 passes and scored a touchdown while playing on a majority of Detroit's snaps. As he gets healthier and more comfortable with the speed of the game following his injury absence, his fantasy potential will only grow. Consider him as a solid WR2 option against a tricky New Orleans pass defense that has allowed the sixth-fewest WR fantasy points this season.","It's fun that his average target from Baker Mayfield this past week traveled 16.7 air yards, by far the deepest of all the Browns' targets. It's not as fun to realize Beckham endured another quiet week working with Mayfield, but at least some advanced metrics suggest big plays are due against this generous Dallas secondary.","This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","Swift saw his playing time dip yet again in Week 3 as Adrian Peterson took over as the top back in the Detroit offense. Until such time as Swift regains a healthy role in the Lions offense, it's safe to leave him on the bench in fantasy.","With Tarik Cohen out for the season, Montgomery is the unquestioned top back in Chicago. He's not a passing-game specialist by any means, but he's seen three targets in each game, and should continue to combine enough rushing production with receiving upside to be an RB2/flex option in most leagues. Even against a tough Colts defense (fifth-fewest points RB fantasy allowed this season), he has enough volume to merit a start in Week 4.",null,"Even with Kenny Golladay back in action for Week 3, Jones retained his starting spot and led the Lions in WR playing time. However, Golladay had the better fantasy output and more targets which is a worrying sign for the veteran. Jones has been a bit of a boom-or-bust option for Detroit dating back to last season, and that doesn't seem likely to change now. Against a tough New Orleans defense in Week 4, consider him as a risky flex pick.","Injured these past few weeks, Crowder's return would likely mean he regains a target-rich role out of the slot. Crowder is \"flexible\" as a WR3 or flex candidate given potential for big workload if active against Denver's pass defense that rates 28th in defending receivers this season.",null,"For all of the buzz about how well Herndon and Sam Darnold connect in practice and preseason play, the results have been quiet. Maybe this choice matchup with Denver might help, as they've allowed the seventh-most fantasy points to tight ends. Herndon remains risky, but at least the matchup is inviting.","This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","Tampa Bay boasts a solid pass defense, along with a stingy run defense. The Buccaneers D/ST is a solid start against the Chargers, as most teams will be for as long as rookie Justin Herbert is under

returns as the clear feature back in Dallas. Since entering the league in 2016, the Ohio State product leads the NFL in carries (1,169) and rushing yards (5,405), and sits second in rushing touchdowns (40). Elliott obviously plays a substantial role as a ball carrier -- and his goal-line work increased last season -- but it was a bit surprising to see his targets fall from 6.3 to 4.4 per game last season. Of course, Elliott's role still allowed him a top-3 finish in touches, yards and fantasy points. The 25-year-old is positioned for a similar role in 2020 behind a strong offensive line and should be off the board in the middle of the first round of drafts.","Mixon enters his fourth NFL season as the clear feature back in Cincinnati. The role has allowed Mixon a top-seven finish in touches, top-11 finish in yards and eight-plus touchdowns each of the past two seasons. Despite the heavy usage, a limited role as a pass-catcher has left Mixon with fantasy finishes of 10th and 13th during that span. Mixon is one of the game's better talents at the position, but the Cincinnati offensive line remains a work in progress and his target share is unlikely to see a significant boost with A.J. Green back, Tee Higgins drafted and Giovani Bernard still in the fold. Consider Mixon a borderline top-10 RB.","After flashing in 11 games as a third-round rookie in 2017, Golladay has emerged as one of the game's top wide receivers over the past two seasons. Golladay has never finished as a top-15 WR in targets, but has put up a pair of 1,000-yard seasons and paced the NFL with 11 touchdown receptions in 2019. A force deep downfield and near the end zone, Golladay finished in the top 10 in YPT, YPR, aDOT and end-zone targets in 2019. Fantasy's reigning No. 9 WR has emerged as Detroit's top offensive weapon. Considering Matthew Stafford missed half of last season, we may have yet to see the 26-year-old's best work. Golladay is a fringe WR1.","Beckham returns for his second season with the Browns following an underwhelming 2019 campaign in which he posted a 74-1,035-4 receiving line and was held to just a single top-10 fantasy week. That stat line would be respectable output for most players, but it's not quite enough for a player who averaged a 96-1,374-12 line during his first three seasons in the league (2014-16). The good news is that Beckham is still in his prime at age 27. He should see some touchdown regression to the mean (4 TD, 5.8 OTD) and the Cleveland offense should be more efficient under new coach Kevin Stefanski. Beckham is best viewed as a mid-to-back-end WR2, but there's obvious upside here.","Brown is entering his second NFL season after quite the roller-coaster rookie campaign. Following a boom/bust first couple of months, the second-round pick peaked after the Titans' Week 11 bye, posting the second-most fantasy points and four top-10 weeks from that point forward. His five top-10 outings for the season trailed only Michael Thomas for the league high. Brown then crashed back to earth in the playoffs with a mere 64 yards in three games. The inconsistency was frustrating, but Brown appears to be the real deal. His 12.5 YPT and 9.0 RAC both topped the position and he dropped only one of his 84 targets. Brown's TD rate will regress (8 TD, 3.7 OTD), but a boost in volume is probable in Year 2. Consider Ryan Tannehill's top weapon to be a fringe WR2 with upside.","The Lions selected Swift with the 35th pick of April's draft. Swift was terrific in Georgia's pro-style offense, producing as both a rusher (440 carries) and receiver (73 receptions) during his three seasons. His efficiency was more solid than spectacular, and he lacks some explosiveness, but he makes up for it with reliability, decent speed (4.48 40-yard dash), quickness and pass-catching prowess. Swift has three-down upside but will begin his career competing for reps with Kerryon Johnson, who figures to focus primarily on ball-carrying, with Swift busier in passing situations. That's likely to limit Swift's fantasy output, but he certainly could flirt with RB2 numbers and is worth a midround pick.","Montgomery's rookie season didn't go as planned, but the 2019 third-round pick remains atop the Chicago depth chart. The Iowa State product wasn't short on volume in his first season, ranking 12th among backs in touches and sixth in carries inside the 5 (14). The problem was a combination of poor rushing efficiency (3.7 YPC, 1.6 YAC) and a lack of volume and effectiveness as a pass-catcher (185 yards on 37 targets). The end result was two top-15 fantasy weeks and a 24th-place finish by season's end. Montgomery will continue to defer passing-down work to Tarik Cohen but is certainly a breakout candidate in his second season. Montgomery is a flex option with RB2 upside.","It took Samuel a couple of months to get rolling, but the 2019 second-round pick worked his way to a prominent offensive role right around the midpoint of his rookie season. From Weeks 10-17, the South Carolina product played on 82% of the 49ers' snaps. Powered by 697 yards and four touchdowns, he was fantasy's No. 9 scoring WR. He kept it up in the playoffs with 229 yards on 16 touches. Samuel was primarily used near the line of scrimmage, posting one of the position's lowest aDOTs (7.7), but also the fifth-best catch rate (71%), the seventh-best YPT (10.0) and the second-best RAC (8.1). A weapon as both a receiver and rusher, Samuel shouldn't struggle for touches in Kyle Shanahan's offense once he returns from a foot injury. He's a solid WR3 option with upside once healthy, so take him with a late-round pick.","Jones, Kenny Golladay and Danny Amendola played 12 games together last season. The target breakdown in those weeks were as follows: Jones had 86 (20% share), Golladay had 85 (20%), and Amendola saw 78 (18%). When Jones was out during Weeks 15-17, Golladay only edged Amendola 23-20 (24%-21%) in that category. This trio is probably closer than you realize in usage, which may lead to Jones being undervalued in fantasy again. He's now 30, but Jones has scored nine touchdowns in two of the past three seasons and was on pace for nine in 2018 prior to an injury. He finished 14th, 27th and 20th in fantasy points per game during that span.","Crowder has emerged as one of the game's top slot/short-area targets and that skill was on full display in his first season with the Jets. The longtime slot man in Washington posted a healthy 78-833-6 receiving line in New York, leading to a 26th-place finish in fantasy points. Crowder finished near the basement of the position in aDOT (8.1) for the fifth time in as many seasons, which limited big plays (6.8 YPT), but allowed him to soak up receptions (16th most). At 5-foot-8, 185 pounds, Crowder won't get you many touchdowns. Heck, he has only 20 career end zone targets. Still, Sam Darnold's top option will catch enough passes to allow for flex production in PPR leagues.","Armstead enters his second professional season competing for lead back duties following the August release of Leonard Fournette. The 2019 fifth-round pick produced 108 yards on 35 carries (3.1 YPC, 1.9 YAC) and 144 yards and a pair of touchdowns on 24 targets (6.0 YPT) off the bench as a rookie. Armstead will certainly defer passing-down work to Chris Thompson, but could emerge as a flex if he fends off Devin Ozigbo (among others) for primary ball-carrier duties. He's a fine mid-round flier.","Herndon is back on the fantasy radar following an injury-plagued 2019 campaign in which he was limited to 16 snaps. The Jets selected Herndon in the fourth round of the 2018 draft and quickly put him in position for a big role. The Miami product was on the field for 63% of New York's snaps and, following a slow start, was fantasy's No. 9 tight end from Week 6 on. His 10.3 aDOT was fifth-highest at the position and helped him to a strong 9.0 YPT (10th). Herndon's 502 receiving yards rank 12th, his catch rate 12th, his YPT fourth and his aDOT second among rookie tight ends since 2007. Herndon is an excellent post-hype target and positioned well for a breakout.","Tannehill signed a four-year extension with Tennessee following an impressive bounce-back 2019 campaign in which he completed 70% of his passes (third best) and posted 9.6 YPA (first). Tennessee scored three-plus touchdowns in 12 of Tannehill's 13 starts, which helped the 31-year-old to the third-most fantasy points among quarterbacks from Week 7 on. Tannehill has been around since 2012, but he has finished only one season as a top-15 fantasy QB and is a strong bet for statistical regression to the mean. With the Titans' extremely run-heavy offense also in mind, the veteran passer is best viewed as a solid QB2.","All eyes are on Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay offense this offseason, but don't overlook a defense that is trending in the right direction. The upward trajectory began last season, with Tampa Bay scoring 15 more fantasy points than the next-closest D/ST from Week 12 on. In total, the Buccaneers ended up third in forced fumbles, seventh in sacks, first in passes defensed and second in D/ST touchdowns. Tampa Bay re-signed Ndamukong Suh, Shaquil Barrett and Jason Pierre-Paul during the offseason, which means 11 of team's top 12 snap-getters on defense are on the 2020 roster. The defense is also loaded with recent early-round picks who could make a leap, including Antoine Winfield Jr., Devin White, Vita Vea, Carlton Davis, Sean Murphy-Bunting, Jamel Dean and Mike Edwards.

put it all together last season, totaling over 1,600 yards from scrimmage and scoring 13 times in his third NFL campaign. The focal point of the Minnesota offense through the first half of the year, injuries and a shift in offensive philosophy limited his impact down the stretch. Rested and ready for the season, there's no reason to doubt Cook in Week 1 against the Packers. He should be a lock for all lineups.","Jones doubled his touchdown total from 2018 to 2019 and was fantasy's second-best back as a result. The fourth-year pro out of UTEP received tons of work in the red zone and figures to be the focal point of the Green Bay offense inside the 20 again in 2020. He had a pair of big games against the Vikings in 2019, so expect more of the same to begin the new season. He's a solid RB2, or perhaps even a low-end RB1, for the kickoff of the new season.","A seemingly lost season in 2019 saw Smith-Schuster struggle with both injuries and poor quarterback play, setting him up as a fun bounce-back target given the return of Ben Roethlisberger to the offense. There might not be a better opening matchup for the USC than the Giants, as New York allowed the third-most yards to receivers last year.","Lockett has taken two big steps forward in recent seasons, first in terms of big plays in 2018, then in terms of volume in 2019. Should he take another step forward in 2020, you'll be very happy to have the speedster in your lineup. He ended last season with a career-high 110 targets and is still on top of Seattle's WR depth chart so, in Week 1, he'll likely be the first receiver to catch the eye of Russell Wilson. Lock him in as a WR2 against the Falcons' mediocre pass defense.","Wilson has showed no signs of slowing down, as his per-game fantasy points average in 2019 was the third-best of his career. He has lots of injuries to contend with among his skill position players, but that's nothing new for the Wisconsin product. He's a reliable fantasy quarterback facing an Atlanta defense that was quite favorable for opposing passers last season. Lock him in as your starter.","From undrafted receiver to breakout tight end, Waller thrived as a steady target of Derek Carr last season. While he's unlikely to approach his awesome target clip last season, Waller should remain a fine fantasy starter heading into a matchup with a Carolina defense missing legendary cover linebacker Luke Kuechly. ",null,null,"As a defense, Baltimore led the league in blitzing while posting a solid turnover rate in the secondary. Given Baker Mayfield's struggles against pressure last season, Baltimore looks like a solid fantasy defense for this division matchup.","Likely to serve as the change-of-pace and third-down option aside Jordan Howard in the Miami backfield, Breida shouldn't be starting in fantasy lineups until we see just how his role and usage play out. It doesn't help his case that the Patriots were among the best defenses against backfields last season.","It seemed like Coleman would be the lead back for the 49ers last season, but injuries and the emergence of other options kept him as just a rotational option. As such, he had his worst-ever season from a fantasy scoring perspective, but flashed moments of the promise we remember from his days in Atlanta. It's always tough to pick a 49ers running back, but Raheem Mostert appears to be the one with the most fantasy potential, so Coleman should head to the fantasy bench as the second-in-line for prime opportunities.","A bit risky to begin the season as a fantasy option given a somewhat cloudy depth chart past Tyreek Hill for the Chiefs, Hardman enters the season with gobs of potential given his field-stretching speed in an offense that often rewards speed and playmaking. Not yet a usable flex play, it does help Hardman's case as a DFS target that the Texans struggled in the secondary last season in allowing the seventh-most fantasy points to receivers.","Drafted in the first round out of LSU, Jefferson appears to be the Vikings' replacement for the traded Stefon Diggs. He scored an incredible 18 touchdowns in 2019 for the Tigers and should slot right into an offense that is efficient, though lacking in a high ceiling. The Packers have an above-average pass defense (eighth in WR fantasy points allowed last season) and Bisi Johnson will be involved in Minnesota's offense, so there's every reason to take a cautious approach with the rookie in Week 1. The potential here is very high, though.","With so many of the Eagles' wideouts hurt, Goedert could be in line for a bigger role in Week 1 against Washington. Normally a team's No. 2 tight end lacks fantasy appeal, but Goedert is regularly involved in Philadelphia's passing game and finished the season with six-plus targets in each of his final eight contests. He's probably a bit too risky for most leagues, but given Washington's struggles to defend tight ends last season, there are worse gambles you could take.",null],"2":["Cook scored twice for the Vikings in Week 1, but touched the ball only 13 times on what was an interesting day for the Minnesota offense. They ran just 52 plays, compared to 78 for the Packers. The Vikings won't always get out-tempoed or outscored like that, and Cook remains one of the top options in fantasy football. He has a mediocre matchup in Week 2 against a Colts defense which allowed only 91 total rushing yards to the Jaguars in Week 1. That said, Cook is a must-start when healthy. Keep him in your lineup.","Jones jumped right back into his 2019 role to start the 2020 season, getting three red-zone rushing attempts and seeing four red-zone passing targets in Green Bay's Week 1 win. He has one of the most fantasy-friendly roles of any running back and is a great option to start in Week 2 against Detroit, who allowed 150 rushing yards to the Bears in Week 1.","The USC product caught all six of his targets for 69 yards and two touchdowns in an encouraging reunion with Ben Roethlisberger. The Broncos were gashed at times by the Titans' receivers in Week 1, lending some hope for Smith-Schuster to deliver another strong line.","Lockett was a major factor in the Seattle passing game in Week 1, picking up eight targets and hauling them all in for 92 total yards. His lack of end-zone visits is a tad worrisome, but the volume is there. Lockett has the big-play ability to win you a game on any given Sunday, even against a tough defense like New England's. Lock him in as a solid WR2. ","Wilson led all quarterbacks in fantasy scoring in Week 1, but faces a much tougher test in Week 2 against the Patriots. Ryan Fitzpatrick threw a trio of picks against New England in Week 1, but Wilson is obviously a superior passer. You should keep starting the Seattle signal-caller for the time being, even in tough matchups. He is one of the best options at his position and has proven to play well against fierce competition.","Even if his stat line looked a bit light, Waller still led the team in routes and targets against the Panthers. One of the rare full-time tight ends in the league, Waller will be plenty busy working against the Saints' exploitable back seven.",null,"An emboldening opener saw Allen become just the third Bills player ever to produce at least 300 yards in the air and 50 on the ground in the same game. With the most rushing scores among quarterbacks since joining the league, maybe Allen can mimic Cam Newton's success against a soft Dolphins defense.","Baltimore paced the NFL in Week 1 in creating pressure on Cleveland's passing game on 34.1% of dropbacks. Houston, meanwhile, has struggled in pass protection for much of Deshaun Watson's career. The point total for this game is found above 50, which isn't ideal for defensive purposes, but Baltimore's big-play potential merits interest from fantasy managers. ","Barely a factor in the game plan for his first game with the Dolphins, Brieda was third on the team in meaningful backfield touches. Somehow behind Myles Gaskin on the depth chart, it's best to simply stash Brieda ahead of a tough matchup with the Bills.","Coleman sits at No. 3 on the 49ers' RB depth chart coming out of Week 1. That's a sure sign to keep him benched in your fantasy leagues. Raheem Mostert is the star of the show at the moment and the fantasy darling of the San Francisco backfield.","A breakout sophomore season in the league isn't likely to materialize if Hardman continues to serve a low-volume role. Afforded just one target, and one well behind the line of scrimmage, Hardman wasn't afforded a real shot at production in Week 1. It doesn't seem like Hardman has scaled the depth chart or even the offense overall in terms of usage, thus Hardman isn't a bankable option for this tough division matchup.","Jefferson split snaps with Bisi Johnson in the Minnesota passing game, but both finished well behind Adam Thielen in terms of overall production to start the season. This offense appears to be led by Thielen and Dalvin Cook. None of the other Minnesota players provide much by way of fantasy upside. Keep an eye on Jefferson, but don't add him to your Week 2 lineups.","Goedert was the beneficiary of Washington's gameplan to keep Zach Ertz in check. He ended up reeling in eight balls for 101 yards and a score. The Rams will likely follow Washingtonâ€™s blueprint in Week 2, keying on Ertz while pressuring Carson Wentz. This sets Goedert up nicely for another productive week for both the Eagles and your fantasy squad.",null],"3":["It was a bad day all around for the Vikings offense in Week 2, but Cook still managed a decent fantasy total thanks to his rushing touchdown and pair of receptions. He's going to get a healthy number of opportunities every week and just has to hope his team is competitive enough to keep him involved as a runner and effective enough to give him scoring chances. Neither is guaranteed against Tennessee, but Cook is far too good to remove from your lineup at this point. Consider him as a solid RB1 against a team that allowed James Robinson to rush for 102 yards and a score a week ago.","With Davante Adams ailing, Aaron Rodgers and the Packers turned to their other star on offense in Week 2. He did not disappoint. Jones rushed for 168 yards, caught passes for another 68, and scored three times in a fantasy-matchup-winning performance. The Saints have been a bit tougher against the run than the pass over the past 18 games, but don't let that stop you from plugging in Jones as a solid RB2 (or even a low-end RB1) for the foreseeable future.","While he's been busy over the first two weeks, it's a bit concerning that so many of Smith-Schuster's targets come around the line of scrimmage. Without much downfield attention, Smith-Schuster becomes more dependant on reaching the end zone to be a fantasy force.","Lockett will be one of the primary beneficiaries of Russell Wilson's MVP-level play, having seen eight targets from one of the league's best passers in both of his first two games. That's a great spot to be in for a fantasy receiver, and it should stay golden in Week 3 against a Dallas defense that was embarrassed by the Falcons last week. Lock in Lockett as a top-tier WR1.","Wilson has scored nine touchdowns through two weeks and next faces a Dallas defense which allowed four scores to Matt Ryan in Week 2. Hopefully you weren't considering benching Wilson, who leads all quarterbacks in scoring this season, but just in case you were, let us reassure you. He's a must-start in Week 3 and beyond.","An awesomely productive Week 2 was fueled by a career-best 16 targets. We don't expect such amazing opportunity rates for this matchup with the Patriots, but it does help Waller's case that double-digit target shares are always within reach.",null,"Allen is the first Bills quarterback since Jim Kelly to open a season with consecutive 300-yard outings. Even as the Rams have proven solid on defense, Allen's dual-threat skill set earns him another big projection.","It's difficult to overlook a productive blitz-heavy defense such as Baltimore's, but if there were ever a week to look to say the Chargers or Browns as streaming options instead of this group, this would be it; the Chiefs present a unique challenge and rarely make it fun for opposing defenses.","Second on the Dolphins in backfield touches in Week 2, Breida appears more valuable at this stage than Jordan Howard. Then again, it's still Myles Gaskin who claims the most rewarding workload, leaving Brieda as a bench stash heading into this matchup with Jacksonville.","Coleman is expected to be out for a few weeks with an injury, so look to Raheem Mostert (if active) and Jerrick McKinnon to carry the load on offense for the 49ers in Week 3.","Sitting on just four targets on the season, it's hard to get too excited about Hardman's production potential as long as he serves such a limited complementary role with Kansas City. With a tough Baltimore secondary up next, Hardman remains merely a depth addition for fantasy purposes.","Jefferson did finish as Minnesota's top receiver in Week 2, but he managed only 44 yards in a horrible offensive output for the Vikings. He's playing in the No. 3 wide receiver role behind Adam Thielen and Bisi Johnson and will need a big boost in playing time to become a viable fantasy starter. Keep him benched for Week 3.","Goedert has registered two straight weeks with eight targets, securing a dozen catches for 131 yards and a touchdown -- and outproducing teammate and fellow TE Zach Ertz. While chances are good that Ertz's production will pick up, it's very apparent that Goedert should remain fantasy relevant in 2-TE sets. Goedert's volume makes him a matchup play with Week 3 being a good spot to use him against a leaky Bengals defense.",null],"4":["Cook had a truly breakout performance in Week 3, racking up 199 total yards and scoring a long touchdown for the Vikings. He'll next face a Houston defense that has allowed the seventh-most RB fantasy points this season. Lock him in confidently as your RB1 for Week 4.","Jones has scored a touchdown in each of his first three outings this season, and will now face an Atlanta defense that is struggling and recovering from yet another embarrassing come-from-behind defeat. The Green Bay back is a must-start most weeks, but that's certainly true against the stumbling Falcons.","This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","Lockett found paydirt three times in Week 3, while also hitting the 100-yard mark for the first time this season. More importantly, he has seen 29 targets through three weeks and is becoming more and more reliable as a top fantasy option. Against a weak Miami pass defense, lock him in as a solid WR1.","Wilson is head and shoulders above the league in terms of fantasy production so far this season, with 14 passing touchdowns and only one interception through three weeks of play. The Dolphins have allowed the third-most QB fantasy points so far this season, so this is a great chance to keep Wilson glued to your QB1 spot in fantasy.","Limited to a quiet outing with just two catches for nine yards this past week with the Patriots focusing on Waller, it's worth remembering he led the Raiders with 18 catches for 150 yards over the first two games. Due for a stronger showing against the Bills this week, Waller remains firmly in the TE1 mix.",null,"Fresh from becoming the first player in Bills history to produce at least four passing scores and one rushing score in consecutive games and just the second player in team history with three consecutive 300-yard outings, Allen is set to thrive as a playmaker against a Raiders defense that rates juts 28th in creating pressures per dropback.  ","The league's most aggressive blitz scheme always presents some value, especially against a green passer for Washington. With some turnover and sack potential in this matchup, Baltimore makes for one of the better plays at the position.","Limited to only three touches and four scrimmage yards, Brieda just isn't a threat to Myles Gaskin for meaningful touches at this stage. Seattle, meanwhile, has allowed the second-fewest yards on the ground to tailbacks.",null,"Averaging a team-high 20 air yards per game against the Ravens, Hardman was a big-play machine on Monday night. Yet with a limited batch of routes each week, Hardman is difficult to trust for fantasy purposes in a tough matchup with New England.","Jefferson had a breakout game in Week 3, hauling in 7-of-9 targets and picking up his first touchdown. All of a sudden, Jefferson has replaced Stefon Diggs across from Adam Thielen and fantasy managers will be faced with the difficult decision each week of predicting which Minnesota wideout will perform better. Against a solid Houston pass defense, we're trusting the veteran Thielen a bit more, but Jefferson is still worthy of a flex start in deeper leagues.","Geodert's left ankle is fractured. Doug Pederson said that the tight end will be out for an extended period of

career has thus far been marred by injuries, but we saw a glimpse of his ceiling during a breakout 2019 campaign. Through Week 14, Cook led the league in rushing touchdowns and trailed only Christian McCaffrey in fantasy points. Cook missed two games and chunks of others but still finished no lower than ninth among backs in carries, receptions, touches, scrimmage yards and touchdowns. Cook's 15 carries inside the 5 were third most in the league, and he scored at least one touchdown in 11 of 14 games. Cook has now missed 19 games because of injury in three seasons, but there's no doubt the 24-year-old is positioned well as run-heavy Minnesota's primary back. He's a strong RB1 despite the durability concerns.","It's fair to say Jones was finally 'freed' in 2019. Green Bay's lead back set career-high marks in nearly every category, exploding for 1,558 yards (seventh most among RBs) and a league-high 19 touchdowns from scrimmage. Jones posted more duds than you'd expect from a top fantasy back (five weekly finishes outside the top 30), but still managed the second-most points at the position. Jones is a near lock for major touchdown regression this season, as his 19 TDs were nearly double his 10.8 OTD. Still, his strong efficiency and role as lead back in the Packers' offense is enough to allow the 25-year-old Jones solid RB1 numbers.","Smith-Schuster enters 2020 looking to bounce back after a rough 2019 season marred by Ben Roethlisberger's season-ending injury in Week 2, as well as various injuries of his own. After pacing all wide receivers in routes run and finishing top 10 in targets, receptions, receiving yards, end-zone targets and fantasy points during a breakout 2018 campaign, Smith-Schuster was held to a 41-542-3 line in 12 games of \"QB purgatory\" last season. Smith-Schuster is still only 23 years old and a strong bet for a rebound season with Roethlisberger back in action. Consider him to be a WR2 with upside.","The 2019 season was Lockett's fifth in the NFL, but his first as Seattle's clear No. 1 wide receiver. It's safe to say he handled himself well, playing through a midseason injury and reaching career-high marks in targets, receptions and yardage. Whereas teammate DK Metcalf paced the NFL in end-zone targets, Lockett finished fourth with 13. Lockett has finished second in catch rate and no lower than 16th in fantasy points both of the past two seasons. His 18 touchdowns are second most at the position during that span. Lockett enters his age-27 season as one of the game's most-efficient receivers and Russell Wilson's top target. He's a solid WR2.","The 2019 season was a tale of two halves for Wilson. He was the top-scoring fantasy QB through Week 6 but was held to three top-12 weeks and the 11th-most points the rest of the season. At the end of the day, he had his eighth top-11 fantasy campaign in as many tries, which includes four top-three seasons since 2014. Wilson remains a force with his legs (he's ranked no lower than ninth among QBs in rushing yards in his career), but he's also ranked top-three in passing touchdowns (33.3 per season) in each of the past three seasons. With Tyler Lockett, second-year receiver DK Metcalf and newcomer Greg Olsen at his disposal, the 31-year-old Wilson remains a solid QB1.","Waller's breakout 2019 season marked one of the most improbable breakout campaigns you'll ever see. Waller was drafted in the sixth round of the 2015 draft as a 6-foot-6 wide receiver. He barely saw the field while dealing with addiction but got back on his feet as a tight end with the Raiders. An absolute force from the get-go, Waller finished no lower than fourth among tight ends in snaps, routes, targets, receptions, yardage or YPT. Waller was held to three touchdowns (3.9 OTD) but finished third in fantasy points. The 27-year-old is Derek Carr's top target and positioned well for another high-volume season. He's a top-five fantasy tight end.","Zuerlein signed with the Cowboys during the offseason following eight seasons with the Rams. Fantasy's top-scoring kicker back in 2017, 'Greg the Leg' has finished just outside the top 10 in each of the past two seasons. Zuerlein's accuracy has been all over the place throughout his career. He nailed 95.0% of his field goals in 2017, but fell to 87.1% in 2018 and a horrific 72.7% last season. On the plus side, Zuerlein was one of only a handful of kickers who didn't miss an extra point last season, and Dallas has finished among the top five in field goal attempts in each of the past two seasons. The 32-year-old is worth a flier in the last round.","Allen is the perfect example of why rushing is so important when it comes to QB fantasy evaluations. The 2018 first-round pick finished as fantasy's No. 6 QB last season despite ranking 23rd in passing yards, 21st with only 20 passing TDs, third worst in completion percentage (59%) and 11th worst in YPA (6.7). Of course, Allen also produced a 109-510-9 rushing line and has now paced the position in rushing TDs in each of his two NFL seasons (17 total). Allen's passing troubles remain a red flag, but the addition of Stefon Diggs should help his cause. As long as he keeps running, Allen will be a back-end QB1 option.","The Ravens lost a ton of top-end talent during the 2019 free-agency period and it showed early, but quality coaching and a few in-season transactions turned things around and allowed their D/ST a third consecutive top-four fantasy season. Baltimore ranked fourth in yardage allowed, third in points allowed and second in D/ST touchdowns, with six. The 2020 offseason brought another exodus of key defenders, including Brandon Carr, Michael Pierce and Patrick Onwuasor, but the additions of Calais Campbell, Derek Wolfe and first-round pick Patrick Queen, as well as the return of Tavon Young to a loaded secondary, sets this unit up for another strong campaign. Consider the Ravens' D/ST a solid starting option.","Breida was traded to the Dolphins and is expected to share backfield duties with Jordan Howard this season. The former 49ers' rotational back has at least 105 carries in each of his three NFL seasons and has ranked no lower than 13th in yards per carry in each of those campaigns. His 5.0 YPC in that span ranks third among 42 backs with 300-plus carries. Breida hasn't done much after contact (1.5 YAC) or as a receiver (91 career targets) but has shown to be an explosive playmaker, which makes the 190-pound back a terrific complement to the 230-pound Howard. Consider Breida a bench option with a shot at flex production.","Coleman opened the 2019 season as the 49ers' lead back but was all but replaced atop the depth chart by Raheem Mostert down the stretch and during the playoffs. Coleman returns to San Francisco in 2020 but simply can't be counted on as a reliable starter. On one hand, it's a good situation, as 49ers' backs led the NFL in rushing yards (2,051) and touchdowns (19) last season. On the other hand, Jimmy Garoppolo didn't target the position much (20th in the category), and job security is almost nonexistent in Kyle Shanahan's offense. Coleman will compete with Mostert and Jerick McKinnon for snaps. Consider him a bench option.","Hardman was limited to 44% of the Chiefs' offensive snaps and a grand total of 41 targets during his rookie season. The 2019 second-round pick provided his fair share of explosive plays with a 26-538-6 receiving line, which provides plenty of optimism for the 23-year-old's future in Kansas City's elite offense. Hardman's short-term outlook is a bit cloudy with both Sammy Watkins and Demarcus Robinson returning, but Hardman is just one depth-chart adjustment or injury away from working as one of Patrick Mahomes' primary targets. You may not be able to start him much early on, but Hardman is an excellent upside target in the mid-to-late rounds.","Minnesota used the 22nd pick of April's draft to select Jefferson ' the de facto replacement for Stefon Diggs. Jefferson is 6-foot-1, 202 pounds with outstanding ball skills and contested-catch ability. The former LSU Tiger also has decent wheels (4.43 40), though he doesn't stand out in terms of perimeter separation or against press, which helps explain why he aligned in the slot 90% of the time in 2019. With only Adam Thielen ahead of him on the depth chart, Jefferson won't be short of playing time as a rookie, which isn't new for the player who paced the FBS with 111 receptions in 2019. Jefferson's 83% catch rate and 18 touchdowns were best in this year's rookie class. Jefferson's short-term upside will be limited by Minnesota's run-heavy offense, but he's still worth a late-round pick.","Goedert spent the 2019 season behind Zach Ertz on the depth chart and missed a game, but still managed a top-10 finish among tight ends in targets, receptions, yardage, touchdowns and fantasy points. A big reason for the high-end production was a massive number of injuries to Eagles' wide receivers and that shows up in Goedert's splits. The 2018 second-round pick posted five top-10 fantasy weeks, but four came after the team's Week 10 bye. Goedert appears to have a bright future, but the 25-year-old will struggle for TE1 numbers barring an Ertz injury.

hit the 1,000-yard mark in 2019 in only 13 games, as he was slowed by injuries but still produced at a high level. He chipped in as a receiver as well, and has demonstrated over his first two seasons that he's an every-down contributor who will only be held back by ailments or his team's offense. The Steelers had a top-five run defense last season when it came to stopping opposing backs from scoring fantasy points, but Barkley is matchup-proof. Start him every week.","About as dynamic of a big-play threat at his position in the league, Hill enters his fifth professional season with a proven rapport with the league's top passing talent. Seems like a good setup for fantasy fun, especially when opening the season against a Houston defense that struggled to contain outside speed last season.","Carson sits atop Seattle's RB depth chart heading into 2020. While the team did add a pair of backs in Carlos Hyde and draftee DeeJay Dallas, Carson is the lead back by any measure and should continue to build on his back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons. He even got a bit more involved in the passing game last season, which was very encouraging and more than enough reason to lock him in as an RB2 for Week 1 against the Falcons.","Murray finished 2019 with the eighth-most points among quarterbacks, but ended the season with 13-or-fewer points in four of his final five outings. He did well against the 49ers last season and he'll get a chance to face them again in Week 1, but they did allow the ninth-fewest points to passers a year ago. Therefore, Murray is only a borderline starting candidate to open the season.","An efficient rookie effort saw Singletary produce some solid scrimmage outings for the Bills, but the drafting of Zack Moss could mean this smaller back loses out on valuable goal-to-go work. That said, Singletary should see enough work on the ground and as a receiver to help support flex value heading into a division matchup with the Jets.","Cook has stepped up to a new level over the past two seasons, scoring 12-plus fantasy points per game when he'd previously never finished a season averaging more than 9.3 points. He has developed rapport with Drew Brees, and that's a great place to be as a pass-catcher. Look for him to provide decent numbers each week, starting with Week 1 against a lackluster Tampa Bay pass defense.","Is the old Gronk back? It's impossible to know just yet, but there is certainly reason to think that taking a season off from the harsh conditions of the NFL might have the future Hall of Famer feeling as good as ever. He'll have to contend with a couple of incredible receivers for touches, but he has as much chemistry as anyone with Tom Brady. Start him if he's on your roster, as he has the upside for a huge game any given week.","Injuries slowed Brees down a bit last season, but his 2019 points-per-game average was on par with 2018. It's a step down from the dominant player of the early 2010's, but still effective enough to lead a fantasy lineup. The Buccaneers were among the 10 most-favorable QB matchups in fantasy last year, so if you have Brees on your squad, this is definitely a week to start him.","After years of being among the most consistent fantasy forces at the position, an injury-plagued 2019 has Cooks as a borderline flex option heading into his Houston debut. The Chiefs were strong against the pass last season, particularly against receivers, adding some risk to Cooks' profile for the opener.","A steady share of the Bills' passing offense last year helped sustain fantasy relevance for Brown in a strong first season playing with Josh Allen. The presence of Stefon Diggs doesn't help Brown's case for this matchup with the Jets given how limited the passing pie could prove for Buffalo. A lighter workload means Brown is a risky flex option against the Jets. ",null,"Minnesota has become a mainstay among the top D/ST units in recent years and should repeat as one of the primary set-and-forget options for 2020. They combined to score 14 fantasy points across two games with Green Bay last season and will host the Packers to begin the year, so you can expect a solid outing from this unit.","The future is so bright that Jeudy has to wear shades. Dated pop culture references aside, the Alabama product lined up all over the field for Nick Saban's powerhouse and should prove versatile at the next level, as well. It's not clear Jeudy will be a major part of the offense right away given the team's run-first agenda and a bevy of other talented pass-catchers, but a meeting with an exploitable Titans secondary at least helps his prospects as a deep-league option.",null,"A presence on just shy of 40% of his team's offensive snaps through two seasons confirms Michel has been an early-down specialist thus far in his career. Dependent on touchdowns to surface as a valuable fantasy contributor, the presence of goal-line maven Cam Newton doesn't seem very helpful to this end. This first matchup appears inviting, at least, with the Dolphins allowing the third-most rushing yards to backs last season. ","The Rams knew how to force turnovers a year ago, but it's very likely that roster turnover might leave this unit a bit worse off than you may remember from 2019. Los Angeles hosts Dallas in Week 1, but might have taken enough of a step back in terms of personnel to consider this D/ST to be benchable against Dak Prescott and friends."],"2":["While Barkleyâ€™s production was expected to be dampened a bit by running behind a young offensive line, gaining just six yards on 15 carries is obviously excessively low. Luckily, his six catches for 60 yards helped salvage the opener. As most teams do, the Steelers keyed on Barkley throughout Week 1's Monday night affair. Even with a couple of rookie lineman blocking for him, Barkley remains an automatic start with Week 2 offering a less-resistant Bears defense.","A touchdown salvaged an otherwise quiet opener for Hill, but the Chiefs' passing game overall appeared to keep things short and quick, as evidenced by the low air yardage rates for Hill and his peers. This said, a few deep shots for this big-play maven could open up any game, even when facing a solid Chargers secondary.","Carson appeared to be getting eased back into his starting role in Week 1, but he did ultimately lead the Seahawks in RB snaps, while proving he can be an option in both the running and passing games. He might not reach the dominant heights he found at times last season, but he should be a key part of the Seattle offense this season, as demonstrated by his pair of Week 1 receiving scores. That said, against a stalwart New England defense, he's a risky RB2 option in Week 2.","The fact that Murray could come away from a matchup with a very tough San Francisco defense with a more-than-startworthy 26 fantasy points says a lot about the second-year pro. He gets a break this week against Washington, a defense that allowed the seventh-most QB fantasy points in 2019. Lock in Murray as a starter in all formats for this fantastic matchup.","We learned a good bit about this backfield in Week 1; Singletary will play on the majority of snaps and consume more targets than rising rookie Zack Moss, all while Moss consumes more high-value red zone work. With a soft opponent like Miami up next, Singletary's potential for a solid dual-threat outing from scrimmage makes him a solid flex in deeper formats.","There will be weeks when Drew Brees will extend the field but, in the opener, he was content to play the short game. Cook was a prime beneficiary, hauling in five balls for 80 yards, including a 44-yarder -- one of the few times Brees looked downfield. Most weeks, Cook is a back-end TE1 option. Week 2 is no exception as the Saints face a Raiders defense which allowed the 10th-most TE fantasy points last season.","Gronkowski looked spry after taking 2019 off. However, he also appeared rusty. Gronk ended up with just two grabs on three targets, despite playing on 54 snaps. He may eventually return to being Tom Bradyâ€™s safety net, but for now heâ€™s merely one of three experienced Tampa Bay tight ends with the ability to catch the ball. Still, facing a lesser Panthers defense in Week 2 renders Gronkowski playable in leagues with more than a dozen teams.","It was obvious the Saints' focus was on ball control, sticking primarily to short passes. All told, the veteran threw for only 160 yards, though he did connect for a pair of red-zone scores. Week 2 should present more of an opportunity to air it out against the Las Vegas secondary, though Michael Thomas is likely to miss several games. Brees used to be automatic but now heâ€™s no more than a matchup play with Week 2 still looking like a start.","Essentially a decoy in his first game with Houston given a lingering injury, Cooks was just fifth in routes and hauled in only two of five target the loss to the Chiefs. It's not clear if Cooks will handle a full workload just yet, and with a challenging matchup with a solid Ravens pass defense, it's likely best to leave Cooks on the pine for this one.","The arrival of Stefon Diggs didn't crush Brown's opportunity rates, rather, the vet led the team with 10 targets and posted an impressive five first downs in the win over the Jets. While double-digits in targets might not happen often for Brown, there should be adequate bandwidth for him in a nice matchup with Miami.",null,"The Vikings finished Week 1 as the worst D/ST unit in all of fantasy. That's a disappointing start from what should have been a set-and-forget option at the position. They're unlikely to be completely shut out of turnovers and sacks again in Week 2, but the Colts did have a solid showing on offense in Week 1 with 445 total yards. As such, look for other potential options for your Week 2 lineups if Minnesota was your top D/ST choice this year.","Some strong highlights from his debut show that Jeudy can handle the big stage, but he's likely to get increased competition for targets with Courtland Sutton and KJ Hamler nearing a return.",null,"New England rushed the ball by design on 65% of their offensive snaps in Week 1. And yet even in such a run-friendly climate, Michel only mustered 10 touches. Converting a goal-line touch was a positive for Michel, but now he also has Cam Newton to compete with for such valuable, and scarce, opportunities. The Seahawks have ceded the seventh-most fantasy points per game to tailbacks since Week 10 of last year, as Michel enters the matchup as a very risky, touchdown-dependent option.","Offensively, the Eagles stumbled out of the gate. Meanwhile, the Rams held the Cowboys in check in Week 1. Los Angeles did not make many big plays in their season-opener, however, and have to travel across the country to face Philadelphia, so they're a risky D/ST start in Week 2."],"3":["In a crushing blow to the Giants and fantasy teams alike, Barkley tore his right ACL against the Bears and is out for the season.","Hill's 54-yard score late in Week 2's win marked his 18th touchdown of at least 50 yards in his career, tied for the most through a player's first five seasons in NFL history. The big-play maven faces a formidable challenge with the Ravens' capable secondary up next, but Hill's big-play potential keeps him in the must-start tier of receivers.","So far this season, Carson has scored three times in the Seattle passing game. Perhaps more importantly, he took a leap forward as a runner in Week 2  -- up to 72 yards from 21 in Week 1. Going over 100 total yards against the Patriots is a good momentum builder heading into Week 3 against Dallas. Carson is a solid RB2 for this matchup with the Cowboys.","One of the best quarterbacks of the 2020 season gets a matchup with last season's sixth-best defense for opposing passers. This seems like an easy choice. Murray offers so much upside thanks to his running ability (158 yards and three scores through two games) and is easily one of the top overall choices at the QB position in Week 3. Start him with confidence.","It was a nice day from scrimmage for Singletary in Week 2 in that he tallied 76 yards and was productive in both phases. The Rams are allowing the 10th-most fantasy points to tailbacks this year, aiding Singletary's case as a solid flex candidate.","The hope was that Cook would fill some of the void resulting from Michael Thomas' absence. Sadly, the tight end's Week 2 target share dipped a bit from Week 1 as he secured just two of his five looks for 13 yards, albeit one for a red-zone score. With or without Thomas in the lineup, Cook should rebound facing a Packers defense which is softer against tight ends than the Raiders, Cook's Week 2 foe. Consider Cook as a borderline starter for this week's matchup in the Superdome.","Game off! Gronkowski may eventually rekindle the spark he and Tom Brady shared in New England but, for now, the 31-year-old former professional wrestler looks to be long in the tooth.  In Week 2, he was targeted just once, resulting in Brady's third interception of the season. It's time to cut bait on the name brand. Even if the former Patriots teammates get on the same page, the results pale in comparison to their championship days.","Despite finishing with 312 yards and a touchdown, Brees' performance on Monday night appeared to be lackluster, as it was obvious he missed top wideout Michael Thomas. Next up is a Packers defense ranking, um, mid-pack in terms of yards through the air, although they have surrendered four passing touchdowns. With a healthy Thomas, Brees is a low-end QB1. Without him, it's best to find someone with a more favorable matchup.","The absence of Will Fuller V from the game plan for much of the day saw Cooks net an awesome 15.4 air yards per target on his eight looks, aiding his breakout 95-yard showing. The Steelers present a challenging defense for receivers, but with some early struggles from Pittsburgh's secondary thus far, Cooks is a reasonable flex option.","Proving productive even with Stefon Diggs commanding a major share of the offense, Brown averaged an awesome 19.8 air yards per target this past week. Such daring usage helps Brown sustain a rewarding rate of big plays. The Rams have a solid secondary, but Brown's fun opportunity rates are hard to deny.",null,"With only two sacks and a single takeaway over their first two games, the once-mighty Vikings D/ST appears to have taken a step back. A matchup with Tennessee presents an opportunity to bounce back, but with 67 scoreboard points allowed through two games, it might be too big of a risk for most fantasy players in Week 3.","A rib injury limited Jeudy in Week 2, but he's expected to play this week and could command a major share of the offense. The Buccaneers struggled against receivers last season, opening up some potential for Jeudy to thrive amid the injury chaos in Denver's passing game.",null,"Allocated just seven touches and again inefficient with his workload, Michel's touchdown-dependent nature again surfaced in Week 2. The Raiders are allowing the fifth-fewest rushing yards per carry to backs, adding to the fade for Michel.","The Rams D/ST has delivered modest fantasy point returns in the first two games and will face Buffalo in Week 3. The Bills have scored an average of 29 scoreboard points per game this season and are led by a seemingly improved Josh Allen, so it might be best to look elsewhere for your Week 3 D/ST."],"4":[null,"Never truly a target hog like his WR1 fantasy peers, Hill instead proves wildly efficient with a series of big plays. With a touchdown each week thus far, Hill will look to make it four in a row facing the Patriots' proven pass defense.",null,"Murray started off the season looking like a fantasy superstar, but his Week 3 performance is a reminder that this is still just a second-year quarterback. The Oklahoma product finished with three interceptions and his worst rushing performance to date, but managed to maintain a QB1-worthy stat line. The Panthers have been sturdy against passers this season, allowing the third-fewest points to the position so far, but Murray's upside is too high to take him out of your lineup in Week 4.","Working as a key fixture in the Buffalo passing game in Week 3 with Zach Moss out, Singletary delivered an awesome day from scrimmage. The Raiders present an ideal matchup in that they've allowed each opponent to rush for at least 160 yards on the ground and have yielded the most fantasy points to backs this year. Even if Moss is active, Singletary is in a good spot to deliver flex value.","After making a catch in the second half of Sunday night's game, Cook injured his groin and limped off the field. Cook enters Week 4 sas questionable. Only play Cook if he's at full strength -- and even then, consider other options. The Lions have one of the top units in defending the tight end, giving up an average of just three catches for 30 yards per game.","Gronkowski paced Tampa Bay in both targets and catches, engulfing 6-of-7 passes in Week 3, albeit for a tame 48 yards. Gronkowski has yet to display any explosiveness in running after the catch. While he may never recapture the production of his salad days, what is apparent is that he is getting in sync with Tom Brady. Even so, with the limited threat of his breaking off a long play, Gronkowski isn't a fantasy lineup consideration.","Say what you want about Brees' arm strength and his ability to throw downfield, the 41-year-old signal caller can still get it done. Note last Sunday night's 288-yard, 3-TD effort, even as it came in a loss to the Packers. Brees will look to get back to his winning ways against a suspect Lions defense. He won't likely need to put the ball in the air as much against a team with such a weak rush defense, so consider Brees as more of a streaming option in deeper leagues.","Houston spread the ball around to a bevy of targets in Week 3, leaving Cooks with just four targets in an uninspired role. With a healthy Will Fuller, Cooks isn't a very intriguing option even with a nice matchup with Minnesota's soft secondary. ","Brown entered Week 3 with a foot issue and exited the game with a calf injury, limiting him to just 13 out of 36 possible routes. If he's able to suit up for this meeting with the Raiders, Brown faces a Las Vegas defense allowing just the fifth-fewest fantasy points to receivers. This said, his steady vertical role is valuable enough to trust him in lineups if he's active for this matchup.",null,"No D/ST is off to a worse start than Minnesota's, as they've allowed 98 scoreboard points and racked up only three sacks and two takeaways through three weeks. A matchup with Houston won't do them any favors, so keep them on the fantasy waiver wire for Week 4.","Busy out of the slot and lined up in different spots on the field as a weapon for Denver in Week 3, Jeudy seems headed in the right direction as the team's top receiver now that Courtland Sutton is sidelined. The Jets present an inviting matchup for Jeudy given New York has allowed 160 yards per game to receivers, aiding his value as a flex candidate.",null,"The Chiefs have been somewhat porous against the run in allowing 108 yards per game on the ground to backfields. Michel, meanwhile, is coming off of a game full of big runs and his first 100-yard outing since 2018. A boom-or-bust rushing threat, Michel isn't quite worth starting.","The Rams have provided a solid return on investment each week as a D/ST, collecting five turnovers and seven sacks over three games. The Giants are up next, and Daniel Jones and company are certainly turnover-prone, while also lacking the high-end scoring upside that could tank the fantasy score for the Los Angeles D/ST.

2019 season fell short of lofty expectations, but the 2018 second-overall pick finished strongly and remains an elite fantasy asset. Barkley, who missed three games because of injury, was on the field for 84% of New York's snaps -- about the same as his rookie season (83%) -- when active. His 16.7 carries per game were up slightly from 2018 (16.3), though his targets inexplicably fell from 7.4 to 5.5 per game. Barkley still managed the third-most fantasy points among RBs during his 12 full weeks. We shouldn't count on a big rebound in targets with Jason Garrett running the offense, but Barkley does figure to see more run at the goal line (only seven carries inside the 5 last season). Only Christian McCaffrey is a clear superior fantasy asset to 23-year-old Barkley.","Hill heads into his fifth NFL season having never finished lower than fourth among WRs in fantasy points per snap. Last season, the speedster missed four games because of injury and saw a slight dip in usage. Still, he remained a dominant fantasy force when active, posting a top-10 week during one-third of his outings (the league's fifth-highest rate). Hill has scored 36 touchdowns in 59 regular-season games and trails only Travis Kelce in target priority on Andy Reid's high-scoring, pass-heavy Chiefs offense led by Patrick Mahomes. Hill is a solid WR1 with added value in non-PPR formats.","Carson put together another solid season as Seattle's lead back in 2019 and returns atop the depth chart for 2020. The 2017 seventh-round pick has missed a total of three games over the past two seasons but finished fifth in rushing yards during both campaigns. Carson has been of value near the goal line (18 touchdowns) and in terms of efficiency (2.26 YAC is fourth best) during that span. Seattle ramped up Carson's passing-game workload last season, which gives him a better shot at his third-consecutive top-15 fantasy campaign, but the 25-year-old will need to fend off Rashaad Penny and rookie DeeJay Dallas for snaps. Consider Carson a fine RB2 target.","Murray's rookie season had its ups and downs, which is exactly what you'd expect from a first-year starting quarterback. The 2019 first overall pick struggled to 6.9 YPA and took a league-high 48 sacks, but he also finished strong by leading the Arizona offense to three-plus touchdowns in eight of the team's final 11 games. Murray's rushing ability helped him to a 93-544-4 rushing line (top-four in all three categories) and an eighth-place finish in fantasy points. Murray was already a strong bet for a second-year leap, but the addition of DeAndre Hopkins further adds to his appeal. The hype might lead to an irresponsible ADP, but there's little doubt Murray has elite upside. He's a solid fantasy starter.","An injury may have limited Singletary's early-season contributions during his rookie campaign, but the 2019 third-round pick quickly overtook Frank Gore upon his return. During Weeks 8-16, Singletary handled a generous 14.9 carries and 4.0 targets per game. He was held to three touchdowns but was ninth among RBs in scrimmage yards, while playing 74% of the snaps during that span. Though he struggled after contact, Singletary's 5.1 YPC was sixth best among backs. Singletary is expected to work as the lead back again this season, but his 5-foot-7, 203-pound frame will limit his volume. Expect rookie Zack Moss to be heavily involved, along with Josh Allen, at the goal line. Singletary may struggle to clear a half-dozen touchdowns but will get enough work to flirt with top-20 production.","After failing to post a single fantasy campaign better than 12th during his first eight NFL seasons, Cook has posted a pair of top-seven finishes (and with different teams) over the past two seasons. Cook missed a pair of games last season, but managed a TE7 campaign thanks to nine touchdowns (his 11 end zone targets tied for most among tight ends and eighth in the league) and elite efficiency (he posted the position's highest aDOT, YPR and YPT). Cook is now 33 years old, but his role as one of Drew Brees' primary targets remains secure. Consider him a borderline top-10 fantasy option.","Gronk is back! The longtime Patriots' superstar ended his retirement and was traded to the Buccaneers, where he'll reunite with his former quarterback Tom Brady. Gronkowski sat out last season after ending 2018 with his seventh fantasy finish of 11th or better in nine NFL seasons. When healthy, effectiveness has never been an issue for Gronkowski (he has never played a season in which he was lower than seventh among tight ends in yards per target or yards per reception), but durability has been an issue (he hasn't appeared in a full 16-game regular season since 2011).'Gronkowski is unlikely to re-emerge as an elite fantasy option, but he's in a good enough situation to allow mid-to-back-end TE1 numbers.","Brees missed six games due to injury last season and also ceded occasional snaps to Taysom Hill. The future Hall of Famer was still fantasy's No. 2 scoring QB during the 10 weeks he was active, producing 28 touchdowns and only three interceptions. Brees continues to win with elite efficiency, having paced the NFL in completion percentage in each of the past three seasons while ranking no lower than 10th in YPA during that span. Brees' supporting cast is arguably better this season, with Emmanuel Sanders added to a group that includes Michael Thomas, Jared Cook, Alvin Kamara and a quality line. Now 41, Brees is a back-end QB1.","Cooks was traded to the Texans during the offseason and will compete for targets with Will Fuller V, Randall Cobb and Kenny Stills. At 26, Cooks is still in his prime, but has already been traded three times. Despite the constant movement, he has finished four of the past five seasons as a top-15 fantasy WR. Primarily a vertical threat, Cooks ranked no lower than ninth in YPT in the three seasons prior to an injury-plagued 2019 campaign with the Rams. Concussions are an ongoing concern for Cooks, but, if healthy, he's in good shape as one of Deshaun Watson's top targets. He should be on your flex radar, though there's certainly WR2 upside to be found here.","Brown's first season with the Bills was a giant success, as the vertical threat set career-best marks in targets (116), receptions (72) and receiving yards (1,060). Brown handled a generous 26% target share during 15 regular-season games and finished 20th at wide receiver in fantasy points. Despite the strong output, Brown's fantasy stock has taken a hit due to Buffalo's trade for Stefon Diggs. With an expectation for reduced target share, a vertical role that limits consistency and receptions, and a run-heavy scheme, it's hard to view Brown as a safe weekly starter. The 30-year-old is a fringe flex option.","Harris enters his second NFL season as part of a crowded New England backfield that includes Sony Michel, James White, Rex Burkhead and Brandon Bolden. A third-round pick last offseason, Harris was limited to five snaps during his rookie campaign. He lacks top-end speed (4.57 40-yard dash) but has decent size (5-foot-10, 216 pounds) and is a powerful, downhill runner with exceptional ball security (zero fumbles in 2018). He's also a good pass-catcher and blocker, which supplies him with three-down upside in the pros. Harris is buried in New England, but one injury could vault him into a big role. He's an end-of-bench stash at best.","The Minnesota D/ST posted its second consecutive fifth-place fantasy campaign last season and has now finished no lower than 11th over the past five seasons. Minnesota has finished top seven in points allowed each of the past five seasons, top five in sacks each of the past two seasons and was top five in both interceptions and forced fumbles in 2019. Despite the success, it's fair to expect a step back in 2020 following the departures of Everson Griffen, Linval Joseph and literally all three of the team's top three corners from 2019. The addition of Michael Pierce helps, and star power remains in the form of Danielle Hunter, Eric Kendricks, Harrison Smith and Anthony Harris, but unproven cornerbacks and overall depth are major red flags. Consider the Minnesota D/ST a borderline fantasy starter.","Denver selected Jeudy with the 15th pick of April's draft. The Alabama product sports a 6-foot-1, 193-pound frame and is extremely versatile, having shown the ability to produce on all levels, as well as in the slot (69% in 2019) and on the perimeter. Jeudy is fast (4.45 40-yard dash), agile and a quality route-runner. Jeudy slots in behind Courtland Sutton but has little competition for snaps otherwise and should be an every-down player out of the gate. Jeudy has WR1 upside down the road but should be viewed as a shaky flex option for 2020 in a run-heavy Broncos offense and with Drew Lock still an unknown.","","Michel remains New England's lead rusher as he enters his third professional season, but this offense certainly has a different feel to it with Tom Brady out of the picture. Thus far, Michel has essentially been limited to a situational, between-the-tackles hammer role. In 29 regular-season games, he has played 37% of the snaps and handled 54% of the carries (15.7 per game) and 3% of the targets (1.1 per game). That usage allowed Michel only two top-20 fantasy weeks in 2019. Perhaps New England will lean more on its 2018 first-round pick with Brady gone, but with his nonexistent role as a receiver and with James White, Rex Burkhead and Damien Harris in the fold, Michel should be viewed as only a flex option in non-PPR leagues.","The Rams' D/ST finished as fantasy's No. 9 scoring unit last season, which marks its third consecutive top 10 and seventh finish of 12th or better over the past eight seasons. The Rams finished eighth or better in forced turnovers and D/ST touchdowns for the third straight season. Los Angeles' 11 top-10 fantasy weeks last season led the league. Seven of those came in 10 games after Jalen Ramsey joined the team. Despite the strong finish, there's reason for some concern here. Ramsey is back (as are Aaron Donald and John Johnson), but three of the defense's top four snap-getters from 2019 (Cory Littleton, Dante Fowler and Eric Weddle) are among the departed, leaving the team with shaky situations at edge rusher, linebacker and corner.

caught an incredible 149 passes in 2019. That was more catches than his 2018 target total. Amazing! With Drew Brees back under center, you can expect more of the same for the elite fantasy receiver. He's the top WR option in the NFL heading into the season opener against Tampa Bay.","It's still not clear if Jacobs will earn more snaps and targets on third down in his second year, but it's fairly obvious he's the lead early-down option for the Raiders. This role could prove particularly productive to open this season given the Panthers allowed the fifth-most fantasy points and the most rushing yards to opposing backs last season.","Ertz has been one of the most reliable offensive options for the Eagles, scoring 22 touchdowns over the past three years. His expected level of performance is probably more along the lines of his 14.4 points per game from 2019 than the 17.5 points per game outburst in 2018, but that's more than good enough for fantasy managers. Set and forget him as your tight end every week.","Cooper has stepped his game up since joining the Cowboys in 2018, and he posted the best fantasy scoring average of his career in 2019 when paired with Dak Prescott and the rest of the Dallas offense for a full campaign. The Rams finished in the middle of the pack last season in terms of allowing WR fantasy points, so this is a solid opportunity for Cooper to begin the season strong. Assuming he's healthy, he's an easy pick as a WR1/WR2 for your Week 1 fantasy lineup.","The second-round pick out of Florida State ran for 14 touchdowns in his final season with the Seminoles and caught four more but, with the Rams, he certainly isn't guaranteed the 261 touches he got at the college level. He should factor heavily into his team's RB plans, but Malcolm Brown will get his fair share of snaps, as well. Heading into Week 1, Akers seems like the better fantasy option of the pair, but you should consider him more of a low-end RB2 in his NFL debut.","The league leader in dropbacks, attempts, and completions back in 2018, Roethlisberger was unquestionably elite during his last healthy season. A soft opening matchup awaits Roethlisberger and vaults him into the QB1 tier for this week, as only the Cardinals and Dolphins allowed more fantasy points to opposing passers than the Giants. ","Gallup burst onto the scene in 2019, rivaling Amari Cooper in most statistical categories, and becoming a solid fantasy option. The addition of first-round pick CeeDee Lamb complicates things a bit, but you should trust in Gallup's talent. After all, the 2018 third-round pick out of Colorado State is no stranger to big numbers as a wideout. He had almost 2,700 yards over his final two seasons in college. Against a mediocre Rams pass defense, Gallup is a solid WR3/flex option for Week 1.","We checked and you don't get more fantasy points for looking cool while smoking a cigar, although Burrow tried his hardest. The poised rookie signal-caller faces an immediate test with the Chargers' deep and dangerous pass rush up first. There will be some fun weeks that Burrow will flirt with streaming value, but this likely isn't the right matchup just yet.","With the third-most rushing yards in the NFL since 2016, Howard brings some potential as a helpful fantasy option in standard (non-PPR) fantasy formats as Miami's bruiser. The downside for this first matchup is somewhat clear, with New England's stingy defense surrendering just 76.1 rushing yards per game to backs last season, fifth fewest in the NFL.","A surname ideal for creative fantasy team names helps Fant's already rising value. One of the most productive tight ends last year in regards to yards after the catch and contact, albeit over a small sample of touches, Fant now needs a leap in market share to ascend to TE1 status. A solid test of his potential comes in Week 1 against a Titans defense that allowed the eighth-most yards to tight ends in 2019.","Anderson was fun to watch during his time with the Jets, as his top-end speed was among the best in the NFL despite a less-than-ideal QB situation during his tenure there. He'll now join Teddy Bridgewater in Carolina and he'll be helped by lining up with D.J. Moore on the other side of the field. That said, Anderson has yet to prove to be a consistent fantasy option, and is no more than a flex flier until he takes the next step with his new team.","The New England D/ST led the league in fantasy scoring by a whopping 43 points last year thanks in part to allowing 47 fewer actual points to opponents. Facing Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Dolphins to begin the season sets up the potential for sacks, turnovers, and rewarding point and yardage allowances for this stout defense.","Isolated to a third-down role and now with more competition for such work with the presence of a gifted rookie running back on the team, Hines doesn't present much fantasy value even amid a friendly opening matchup.","Peterson rushed the ball 211 times in his age-34 season a year ago but was let go by Washington and picked up by the Lions just ahead of Week 1 action. The backfield situation in Detroit is unclear at best, but rookie D'Andre Swift will likely be the main back when healthy. Should Swift miss time, Peterson could see a healthy number of touches. Still, it's tough to bank on that for your Week 1 fantasy lineups.",null],"2":["It was already a subpar opener for Thomas, who had reeled in just three balls for 17 yards. Then, late in the fourth quarter, Alvin Kamara hit Thomas on the back of the leg, causing him to suffer a high-ankle sprain. The star wideout will likely be out for several weeks.","It was a great outing for Jacobs in the opener against the Panthers; the second-year tailback tallied a career-high three touchdowns and set career highs in receptions and receiving yardage. Emergence as an every-down back vaults Jacobs into the RB1 mix for this meeting with a capable Saints defense.","Ertz is consistently the recipient of extra attention from opposing defenses and when the focus is combined with a strong pass rush, Ertzâ€™s numbers can suffer. Such was the case in Week 1 as the Washington defense kept Ertz in check after an early touchdown, holding him to only three catches for 18 yards and the score. The Rams have a chance to do the same in Week 2, though Ertz is a must-start. After all, the Eagles always look to get him involved, regardless of the matchup.","Cooper fell short of the century mark and didnâ€™t reach the end zone in Week 1, but catching 10 passes for 81 yards is still solid production. Heâ€™s in store for another big week, facing an Atlanta defense which allowed 322 passing yards and four scores to the Seahawks. Cooper remains the top dog in Dallas and a must-start WR1 for fantasy.","Akers got his fair share of carries in his NFL debut, but couldn't make the most of them, picking up only 39 yards on 14 attempts. Meanwhile, Malcolm Brown had a fantastic day as the starter and appears to be the Rams' top RB option. Akers' playing time was encouraging, but don't pencil him into your starting lineup just yet.","Becoming just the eighth player in NFL history with 50 career games with at least three touchdown passes, Roethlisberger shook off the early rust against the Giants to deliver a solid line in the end. The Broncos are missing key pass rush talent at this stage, aiding Roethlisberger's solid streaming value.","While Gallup caught a modest three passes for 50 yards in Week 1, it could have been more if he hadnâ€™t been flagged for offensive pass interference, taking away a 47-yard gain that would have put the Cowboys in position to kick a late game-tying field goal. More importantly, even though he lead  Dallas receivers in snaps, Gallup isnâ€™t the clear cut No. 2 receiving option with rookie Ceedee Lamb in the picture. Even so, Gallup is a WR2/WR3 option for Week 2 as the Cowboys should be able to throw against the soft Falcons secondary.","With Burrow's close loss this past Sunday, No. 1 draft picks are now winless in their last 13 starts to open their career (0-12-1). It was positive for his fantasy profile to see Burrow scramble for 46 yards on the ground, including a 23-yard score. The passing results were ugly at just 5.4 yards per attempt, but the Chargers are a top pass defense. An in-state matchup with Cleveland's blitz-heavy defense results in Burrow as a mid-tier QB2.","It's probably not good to have more touches than yards, which was the case for Howard this past week. In what now appears to be a murky committee with Matt Brieda and Myles Gaskin, Howard enters Week 2 against a top defense without any real fantasy appeal.","An awesome outing against the Titans netted Fant 56 yards after the catch and a touchdown. The Steelers have been solid against tight ends dating back to last season, but at least Fant claims a rewarding share of the Denver offense heading into the tough matchup.","Andersonâ€™s first game with his new team was a success, fueled by a 75-yard TD catch, one of six receptions for 115 yards. Anderson is athletic and capable of making big plays. Just donâ€™t expect the same level of production each week, beginning with a Week 2 meeting with an improved Tampa Bay unit. That said, the Buccaneers secondary is young and susceptible to deep threats, so Anderson checks in as a WR3/flex option.","With three picks in the opener, the Patriots picked up where last year left off when they led the league with 25 total picks. Russell Wilson presents a unique challenge for this group, but their strong point and yardage metrics over the past year suggest fantasy value is still present.","With 27 routes run and two scores in Week 1, Hines was at his playmaking best as a change-of-pace threat for the Colts. A season-ending injury to Marlon Mack supports increased work for Hines ahead, especially as 37% of Rivers' targets went to backs in Week 1. The Vikings are proving inconsistent on defense, with Hines entering the matchup as a risky flex option. ","Peterson touched the ball on 17 of his 24 offensive snaps in Week 1, leading the Lions in rushing, despite having just joined the club days prior. Detroit has several options at running back but, at this point, Peterson seems to be the best of the bunch. That said, he will likely cede passing-game targets to his teammates and play on only a limited number of snaps, so he is a risky flex option in Week 2 against a Green Bay defense that kept Dalvin Cook in check to start the season.",null],"3":["Thomas missed the Monday night affair with a high-ankle sprain. The initial diagnosis was for Thomas to be out  2-to-4 weeks, but he's recovering faster than expected, to the point that he actually heads into Week 3 as only questionable. Monitor the practice reports as it's unlikely the Saints will ask Thomas to be a decoy or to risk further injury. If he's active for New Orleans, he should be active for you.","A true every-down threat now that the Raiders are allowing Jacobs to handle the majority of receiving routes out of the backfield, Jacobs handled a whopping 30 touches in a big Week 2 showing. The Patriots are better against the pass than the ground game, so Jacobs will prove busy this week as the offensive engine for Las Vegas.","Those expending an early pick on Ertz typically expect around eight catches for 60 yards and a touchdown per game. Unfortunately, that's his current stat line through the first two contests. Ertz's woes are more than just facing good TE defenses. After all, teammate Dallas Goedert has excelled in the early going. Regardless, Ertz has a strong chance of getting back on track against the Bengals, who are the league's most generous pass defense.","After a late-season slide in 2019, Cooper's draft stock dipped a bit for 2020.  Thus far, he's rewarding those who took the chance on him.  Although Cooper has yet to score a touchdown in what has otherwise been a solid start to the 2020 campaign, that could change this week. He takes on a depleted Seahawks secondary allowing a league-high 731 yards to receivers -- over 200 more than the next closest team.","Akers suffered a rib injury in Week 2 and might not be fully healthy by the time Week 3's contest with Buffalo rolls around. The rookie was splitting time at running back, anyway, and this likely means he'll take more of a reserve role behind the duo of Malcolm Brown and Darrell Henderson Jr. against the Bills. Keep him on the bench.","Two scores in Week 2's win gives Roethlisberger 368 career passing touchdowns, passing Eli Manning for eighth in league history. Next up is a somewhat inviting matchup with Houston, a defense allowing 19 fantasy points per game to quarterbacks and without many playmakers in the back seven.","With so many talented players, someone on the Cowboys is likely to come out on the short end of the stick. In Week 2, that was Gallup, who captured just 2-of-5 targets for 58 yards. He should get more looks against a Seahawks defense that was torched by both Matt Ryan and Cam Newton for a combined 831 yards over the first two weeks. Until Ceedee Lamb leapfrogs to No. 2 on the Cowboys' WR depth chart, Gallup remains a solid WR3.","Fresh from producing the most completions in a game by an NFL rookie, Burrow next faces a motivated Philadelphia defense that has struggled to contain opposing passers. While the Eagles have some talent on the line, a thin back seven could help Burrow deliver another solid statistical showing.","An inefficient start to his career with the Dolphins has left Howard without much fantasy appeal entering Week 3. The meaningful passing downs are going to Myles Gaskin, while Howard has been stuffed on many of his own early-down opportunities. The Jaguars aren't stingy against the run, but Howard's just not in a good spot to deliver fantasy fun. ","With Denver's receiving corps ravaged by injuries, Fant could serve a big role in the team's passing offense going forward. The Buccaneers have been solid against tight ends this season, but Fant's blend of athleticism and usage makes for a fun streaming option. ","In Week 2, Anderson eclipsed the century mark in receiving yards for the second straight week, only one fewer time than all of last season. He'll be hard-pressed to make it three straight weeks facing a Chargers secondary that was able to hold Tyreek Hill to only 99 yards last week. Anderson's early success merits flex consideration, but don't get used to this level of production.","An early pick-six boosted this group's fantasy output in Week 2. The Raiders have one of the league's better protection rates on the offensive line, but the Patriots' stingy overall defensive metrics merits trust in all leagues.","On the field for only three plays in the second half to Jordan Wilkins' 15, Hines also lost out on receiving duties with Jonathan Taylor doubling him in routes run. Without an important slice of the offense if such usage patterns persist, Hines is an easy fade heading into a matchup with a struggling Jets defense.","Peterson saw his carries cut in half in Week 2, as the Lions moved to a true three-man rotation at the RB position. As such, none of the trio (Peterson, D'Andre Swift and Kerryon Johnson) merit consideration for your fantasy lineup, even against an Arizona defense which has allowed the fifth-most RB fantasy points this season.",null],"4":["After missing the past two games, Thomas hopes to return to practice this week and may well suit up against the Lions on Sunday. Thomas' return would be timely as Detroit has surrendered the eighth-most yards to opposing wideouts, along with four touchdowns. If Thomas is active for the Saints, he should be active for you.","Held to 71 scrimmage yards on 16 carries with no touchdowns in a modest Week 3 showing, Jacobs troublingly lost some work on third downs in the loss. The hope is Jacobs, a proven RB1 option by now, returns to a busier every-down role in a matchup with a tough Bills defense allowing just 22 fantasy points per game to backfields. ","While Ertz has been steady, he's yet to register the dominating type of game expected from a top-three tight end. It could happen in Week 4 as his target share should increase with Dallas Goedert out. Against an injury-riddled San Francisco secondary, look for Ertz to finally reward those expending significant draft capital on the tight end.","Even though Cooper has yet to find the end zone this season, he's been productive, averaging eight-plus receptions for almost 90 yards a game. He's in a great spot to notch his first score in Week 4, lining up against a Browns secondary that has already relinquished five TD passes. Cooper may not be a WR1, but this could be the week he busts out with a top-10 effort at the position.","With Akers sidelined in Week 3, Darrell Henderson Jr. stepped up and provided the Rams with an excellent performance out of the backfield. Looking ahead to Week 4, even if Akers returns, Henderson appears to have claimed the top spot at running back here and is the player to start in fantasy.","This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","In Week 3, Gallup more than doubled his seasonal yardage output, garnering 138 yards on six catches and his first score of the season. Dak Prescott likely won't throw for another 450-plus yards this week, but Gallup's big-play ability keeps him in the running for a WR3/flex designation against a Browns secondary that has given up five WR touchdowns.","In becoming the first rookie QB in Bengals history with consecutive 300-yard passing games, Burrow is becoming an intriguing fantasy option early into his career. With the Jaguars allowing 2.9 points per drive to opponents, the fourth-highest clip in the league, Burrow is positioned to produce a strong streaming performance.","As a tribute to Jerome Bettis, Howard handled three touches while producing a single yard and added another touchdown. Without any real value between the 20s, it's wise to fade Howard ahead of a difficult matchup with a solid Seattle rush defense.","A spike in attention saw Fant earn a team-high 10 targets in Week 3. With the team's receiving corps so young and missing proven veteran production to injury, Fant could again prove busy against the Jets, a team allowing nearly 15 fantasy points per game to tight ends.","After eclipsing the century mark in both of the first two games, Anderson registered only 55 yards on five catches in Week 3. Still, Anderson led Panthers wideouts with six targets and has established himself as a presence on his new team. With a decent floor and big-play ability, Anderson has earned WR3/flex status.","Another week and another series of big plays from the Patriots defense in a win over the Raiders. This coming week, of course, is a much different story given the Patriots face an elite Kansas City offense. It's difficult to not use a strong D/ST, but it could be wise to stream another group and stash the Patriots for a week. ","Grinding out 61 scrimmage yards and nearly matching Jonathan Taylor in touches reveals that Hines will continue to play a sizable role from the Colts' backfield. The Bears are allowing a generous 4.9 yards per carry to backs this year, eighth most in the NFL, but Hines will need to surface as a productive receiver to help fantasy managers.","The veteran back has settled into a starter's role for the Lions, handling 23 touches in Week 3 and leading the team in snaps out of the backfield. His playing time increase coming out of Week 2 against the Packers is an encouraging sign, making him a borderline start-worthy option moving forward.

is fresh off a historic 2019 season in which he set a single-season record for receptions (149) en route to outscoring the next-closest wide receiver by 99 fantasy points. Incredibly, Thomas finished as a top-five fantasy WR nine times during his final 12 games of 2019. During his four NFL campaigns, Thomas has finished no lower than ninth in receptions, yards, catch rate and fantasy points. Thomas' massive 32.5% target share will be hard to repeat, but history suggests he'll still be in the vicinity. Couple that with the return of Drew Brees and the 27-year-old Thomas is primed for another elite performance. He's a top-five overall fantasy asset.","Jacobs returns as the feature back for the Raiders following an extremely impressive rookie campaign. The 2019 first-round pick averaged a healthy 4.75 YPC on 242 attempts and ranked fourth among backs with a 2.25 YAC. Jacobs flashed with four top-10 fantasy weeks but missed three games because of injury, and his output was capped by a limited role as a receiver (27 targets). Coach Jon Gruden has consistently expressed a desire to target Jacobs more often, which adds some optimism that Jacobs can become a workhorse back. Of course, until that actually happens, the 22-year-old is best valued as a fringe top-12 fantasy back.","Ertz had his hands full playing through injuries and double coverage last season, but the veteran tight end still managed his third consecutive campaign as a top-four fantasy tight end. Ertz hasn't finished lower than fifth in targets, sixth in receptions or seventh in yardage at the position since 2014. He's also ranked no lower than fourth in touchdowns and OTD each of the past three seasons. Third-year Dallas Goedert is looming, but Ertz enters his age-29 season as Carson Wentz's top target and remains a top-five fantasy tight end.","Cooper re-signed with the Cowboys during the offseason and returns as Dak Prescott's top target. In 2019, Cooper produced his fourth 1,000-yard season in five tries while setting career-best marks in receiving yards, touchdowns and fantasy points in his first full campaign with Dallas. Incredibly, Cooper has yet to finish a season higher than 10th in fantasy points but, in five seasons, he has managed to post four 1,000-yard seasons and three seasons in a row with seven-plus TDs. He also has finished among the top receivers in catch rate and YPT for the past two seasons. Cooper doesn't get the same amount of targets of other top-end WRs, but the 26-year-old's top-end talent -- and Dallas' high-scoring offense --secures his spot as a strong WR2.","The Rams selected Akers with the 52nd pick of April's draft. The tough and elusive Akers measures in at 5-foot-10, 217 pounds with solid speed (4.47 40-yard dash) and good strength (20 bench reps). Despite lacking some big-play ability and having to do most of his damage after contact last season (5.0 YPC, 1.7 YBC), Akers posted one of the best YAC/forced missed tackle profiles in this year's rookie class. The Florida State product will open his career in a wide-open competition with second-year back Darrell Henderson and Malcolm Brown to replace Todd Gurley. He might not do much as a receiver, but if Akers is able to claim a majority of the carries and goal-line work, he could quickly join the RB2 discussion. Grab him in the middle rounds.","Roethlisberger is back in Pittsburgh after missing all but two games due to injury last season. The last time we saw Roethlisberger for a full season, the Steelers' offense set a franchise record with 51 touchdowns in 2018. Roethlisberger paced the NFL in dropbacks (712), attempts (675) and completions (452), while finishing top-five in passing yards (5,086), passing touchdowns (34) and fantasy points (342) that season. The 38-year-old finished eighth or better in fantasy points per game in five straight seasons prior to 2019. Roethlisberger adds little with his legs, but he has a good line, an intriguing WR trio led by JuJu Smith-Schuster, and newcomer TE Eric Ebron in the fold. Consider Big Ben a top-15 option with QB1 upside.","Most would agree that Gallup is the Cowboys' No. 2 wideout behind Amari Cooper, but it's not as clear-cut as you might think. In 13 full games together last season, Gallup played on 44 more snaps and was targeted four more times than his counterpart. Both were top-10 fantasy receivers during those weeks. Gallup looks like the real deal following a breakout second season in which he posted a 66-1,107-6 receiving line and ranked ninth among wide receivers with a 16.8 YPR. The 24-year-old has solidified himself as one of Dak Prescott's go-to targets and, even though his workload could drop slightly with CeeDee Lamb in the mix, he could make up for some of that with more usage near the goal line. He had only three end-zone targets last season. Consider Gallup as a borderline WR3.","The Bengals selected Burrow with the No. 1 pick of April's draft. Burrow doesn't have the strongest arm, but he is extremely accurate and has good size (6-foot-3, 221 pounds), playmaking ability and mobility. The LSU product completed 76% of his passes, registered as off target on 7.7% of his throws and posted a 94.9 total QBR during the 2019 season, all of which were best in this year's rookie class. Burrow also adds value with his legs (368 rushing yards, 5 TDs), which only adds to his fantasy upside. Burrow will be a Week 1 starter, but as is the norm for rookie passers, he's a long shot to reach QB1 status in 2020.","Howard signed with the Dolphins following four seasons with Chicago and Philadelphia. The 2016 fifth-round pick has racked up 3,895 rushing yards in his four pro seasons, which trails only the totals of Ezekiel Elliott and Todd Gurley for most during that span. Howard is obviously a very effective rusher but has struggled as a receiver, averaging an ugly 5.4 yards per play on 119 career targets. A top-20 fantasy back during his first three seasons, Howard might struggle to get back to that territory as he operates as an early-down and goal-line complement to Matt Breida in Miami. The 25-year-old hammer is a borderline flex option in non-PPR leagues.","The Broncos selected Fant in the first round of last year's draft and proceeded to put him on the field for 68% of their offensive snaps. That's a healthy number for a 21-year-old rookie, as was Fant's TE16 fantasy campaign. The Iowa product was a game-changer with the ball in his hands, pacing 41 qualified tight ends with an 8.3 RAC. His 562 receiving yards rank sixth and his 8.9 YPT fifth among rookie tight ends since 2007. Fant's usage actually declined quite a bit in December, but there's little doubt he's a strong candidate for a big second-year leap as one of Drew Lock's top targets. Fant has elite upside and should be on your radar in the middle rounds.","Following four seasons with the Jets, Anderson signed with Carolina during the offseason. Anderson went undrafted in 2016, but went on to appear in 62 of 64 games with New York, hauling in 206 passes for 3,034 yards and 20 touchdowns. Anderson was limited to one strong fantasy campaign (18th in 2017) and finished 39th and 40th in the past two seasons. In Anderson's defense, a position-high 33% of balls thrown his direction were 'off target' last season. In Carolina, the 26-year-old vertical threat will work alongside DJ Moore and Curtis Samuel in Matt Rhule's new-look offense led by QB Teddy Bridgewater. Consistency is unlikely with Christian McCaffrey as the focal point of the Panthers' offense, so Anderson is safest as a borderline flex play in deeper leagues.","The Patriots were the top-scoring fantasy D/ST by a massive 34 points last season. No D/ST has finished No. 1 in the category in back-to-back seasons over the past decade, but New England has been very reliable under Bill Belichick, ranking in the top 10 seven of the past eight seasons. Last season's unit was incredible, ranking first or second in INTs, yardage allowed, points allowed, D/ST touchdowns and forced turnovers. Though we should expect another solid campaign, keep in mind that the Patriots already regressed from their early 2019 dominance, ranking as the No. 12 D/ST from Week 9 on. The unit also had a rough offseason, losing and not completely replacing key performers Kyle Van Noy, Jamie Collins, Duron Harmon and Danny Shelton. A stacked secondary led by Stephon Gilmore and Devin McCourty remains in place, but we should expect a return to midrange starter production from this unit in 2020.","Marlon Mack and Jonathan Taylor are the Colts' primary ball carriers, but it's Hines who has been handling passing situations. The 2018 fourth-round pick ranked eighth among backs in routes and seventh in targets with Andrew Luck in 2018 before falling to 27th and 16th, respectively, with Jacoby Brissett last season. Hines' receiving efficiency has been a problem (career 5.3 YPT and nine drops), and his 190-pound frame hasn't allowed him much volume or efficiency as a rusher (3.7 YPC on 137 career carries) or in the scoring department (six career TDs). Perhaps Philip Rivers will inject some life into Hines' fantasy stock, but the third-year back will need to significantly improve his game. He's worth only a late flier in PPR.","Peterson was released by Washington just prior to Week 1. Peterson ranked 17th among running backs with 898 rushing yards last season but didn't score much (five TDs) and was a nonfactor as a receiver (23 targets). Peterson is still an effective rusher at age 35, but the reigning No. 33 scoring fantasy back had zero top-10 fantasy weeks in 2019 and is a strong bet for a significant decrease in touches in 2020 regardless of landing spot.

<h3>Get all players from all teams</h3>
<p>To extract the players for each team, we first need to know how many players are on each team each week. One might think this is consistent, but with an IR slot, this may change from week to week.</p>
<p>First we create a function to determine how many roster spots are on a given team.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_roster_slots &lt;- function(team_number=1){
  return(tibble(team_number = team_number, player_slot = 1:length(ESPNFromJSON$teams$roster$entries[[team_number]]$playerPoolEntry$player$stats)))
}</code></pre>
<p>Then we map that over all teams.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>team_player_slots &lt;- purrr::map_dfr(1:number_of_teams,~get_roster_slots(team_number = .x))

team_player_slots</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 182 x 2
##    team_number player_slot
##          &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;
##  1           1           1
##  2           1           2
##  3           1           3
##  4           1           4
##  5           1           5
##  6           1           6
##  7           1           7
##  8           1           8
##  9           1           9
## 10           1          10
## # ... with 172 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Now, we map the <code>team_number</code> and <code>player_slots</code> data to the <code>player_extract()</code> function to get every player from every team.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>team_list &lt;- 
  purrr::map2_dfr(
