<p>Midway through my first semester teaching at West Point, my mentor, asked me what “scholarship” I was working on. To be honest, at the time, I was doing my best to make sure I understood what material I was teaching the next day and making sure my grading was up-to-date. I had been tinkering around with the idea of ‘data scraping’ which was a nebulous term to be then. I was intrigued by it and had google searched ways to get data in the days before (my old tried and true method of copy and paste was frustratingly slow…).</p>
<p>I spouted off that I was interested in data scraping and he responded immediatly with something to the effect of, “Great! You should put together a presentation for the upcoming MORS Conference.”</p>
<p>Knowing even less about what a <em>MORS</em> was, I set to work to figure out enough about data scraping to make a respectable presentation and the link below is the ioslides presentation using R Markdown.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://dusty-turner.netlify.com/mors_presentation">June 2017 MORS Presentation on Data Scraping in R</a></strong></p>
<p>I learned a ton – to include what MORS stands for <strong><a href="http://www.mors.org/">Military Operations Research Society</a></strong>. I am grateful to be pushed, and honored to share my presentation.</p>
