<div id="its-that-time-of-year" class="section level2">
<h2>Its that time of year!</h2>
<p>Its that time of year again. The time when we dust off the old ESPN fantasy football API R code and fix everything that broke in the last year.</p>
<p>Here’s what I hope to show over the next few posts.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How to access your ESPN public fantasy football league’s data.</li>
<li>How to organize that data and create a few interesting displays.</li>
<li>How to create a dashboard to supplement your league’s fun.</li>
</ol>
<p>My ultimate goal is to build this into a package on Github. I’ve got that started, but its currently a work in progress.</p>
<p>All this code and more is located at my <a href="https://github.com/dusty-turner/fantasyfootball2020">github</a>.</p>
<p>And a special thanks to my friend and collaborator <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jim-pleuss-0a10bb81/">Jim Pleuss</a> who really enhanced so much of this project!</p>

<h2>A little background</h2>
<p>This ESPN API exploration is a fun annual process. I first started doing this in <a href="https://www.dustysturner.com/post/espn-yahoo-api-navigation/">2018</a>. In 2019, after some hacking and some updates, I posted about how to access <a href="https://www.dustysturner.com/post/espn-fantasy-football-v3-api-an-r-solution/">public leagues</a>, how to access <a href="https://www.dustysturner.com/post/espn-fantasy-football-v3-api-for-private-leagues-python-through-r/">private leagues using reticulate and python</a>, and how to access <a href="https://www.dustysturner.com/post/espn-fantasy-football-v3-api-for-private-leagues-an-r-solution-finally/">private leagues in R</a>. I went so far last year as to <a href="https://www.dustysturner.com/post/fantasy-football-2019-analysis/">build a dashboard</a> with the data to further analyze my league.</p>
<p>Well, in 2020, ESPN changed their some of their end points. After a lot of exploration and the help of Chrome’s inspect tool, I present code to access ESPN’s API. This <em>should</em> work for any league. If you find it does not work for your league, I’d be happy to take a pull request or two to handle more nuances.</p>

<h2>How to access the API</h2>
<p>In the function below, you provide arguments for your leagueID and the week of the information you would like to extract.</p>
<p>To find your leagueID, look at the URL of your fantasy football home page on ESPN.</p>
<p>The output of this function will be a JSON file. I provide code to explore the JSON file as well.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)

season, Kamara couldn't repeat his incredible 18-TD performance from 2018 -- and injuries certainly played their part. That said, he was always due for a bit of regression in the scoring department. He still managed a healthy 18 points per game and hopes to be healthy heading into Week 1 against the Buccaneers, who were strong against the run but not against the pass in 2019. Since Kamara can make things happen in both phases of the game, he's still a solid RB1 option in fantasy.","Hopkins has thrived with varying levels of quality at quarterback in his career. Now he gets the chance to line up alongside a rising star in Kyler Murray. That should be a great opportunity for the veteran out of Clemson.  He gets a perfectly fine matchup against a decent 49ers pass defense (12th-fewest WR points allowed last year) in Week 1. He's a must-start every week, and this is no exception.","Evans or Godwin? In most weeks, we're going to say both. With Tom Brady under center, you can expect both of the Buccaneers' elite receivers to get plenty of good looks. Evans had his ups and downs last season, but if you locked him into your lineup when he was healthy, you were happy with the end results. Well, he's healthy and ready to go for Week 1, so he's an easy pick as a WR1.","Thielen was the star of the Minnesota passing game in 2018, but he was beseiged by injuries in 2019 and never found consistent playing time as a result. Reports from camp are encouraging and it seems like the 30-year-old is back and ready to go for 2020 -- and he'll be needed. With Stefon Diggs no longer on the team, Thielen is truly the star of the show in the passing game. He's a WR1 this week against the rival Packers.","Posting awesome per-touch metrics at Wisconsin and the fastest 40 among running back prospects at the 2020 combine, Taylor enters the NFL with some appealing upside. Without any preseason games to provide information, it's unclear just how the workload share between Taylor and Marlon Mack will play out. Given that the Jaguars allowed nearly 26 fantasy points per game to backs last season, it's likely that Taylor can provide flex-worthy production even amid a timeshare with Mack to begin his career.","If you can set aside the contract drama and only consider Prescott's performance and surrounding cast, he's a lock to start every week for your fantasy squad. He took a step forward in 2019, posting career-highs in both yards and touchdowns through the air, resulting in the best fantasy scoring average of his career. He should do more of the same in 2020, starting with Week 1 against a Rams team that ranked near the middle of the pack in stopping the pass a year ago.","Welcome back to fantasy football, where figuring out which San Francisco running back will do best this week often means the difference between a win and a loss. Mostert certainly had a breakout season a year ago, but his overall volume was still very low. Perhaps his huge performance in the NFC Championship Game against the Packers will earn him more playing time in 2020, but there's still a big risk. He's worth a spot in your lineup as a flex for now. If you do opt to sit him in Week 1, definitely hold onto him in case he earns a more full-time gig.","Going from a completion machine of a quarterback to Josh Allen isn't exactly an upgrade for Diggs, but there is at least seemingly increased potential for big plays given Buffalo's bolder downfield approach. The Jets were middle-of-the-league in most defensive metrics facing receivers last season and experienced a sizable downgrade at safety over the summer. Add this all up and Diggs is a solid third receiver or flex option for his Buffalo debut.","The top three receivers for the Giants appear to be the same as last season, with Shepard, Golden Tate and Darius Slayton competing for passes from Daniel Jones. However, Saquon Barkley and Evan Engram also factor into that equation, and none of the receivers stand out quite enough on their own to merit a strong recommendation for your fantasy lineup. Shepard is a reliable player and is an option for the flex spot in most leagues, but don't ramp up your expectations too high.","A talented big-play threat from the tight end position, Henry enters his fifth year in the league with a new quarterback but a similar role as the team's top option over the middle. There is some risk present in that Henry is playing with a new quarterback, but a friendly matchup against a porous Bengals pass defense helps his case ","Murray has been a productive running back over the past couple of seasons despite inconsistent playing time, and he's exactly the sort of back to keep stashed away on your bench. When he's starting, Murray is worth having in your lineup, but unless Alvin Kamara is out for Week 1, you'll probably find many better options for your fantasy lineup.","Rodgers took a bit of a step back in 2019, and it's hard to imagine that his lackluster receiving corps wasn't the reason why. The veteran has lost a bit of efficiency, to be fair, as his 62% completion rate was definitely on the low side. Even so, we can still expect him to deliver the occasional big game -- just maybe not against the Vikings. Minnesota held Rodgers to only two touchdowns across their two meetings in 2019, making him a very risky QB start in Week 1 against this same team.","Tom Brady and the Buccaneers will head to New Orleans to open the season, and it will be an immediate test for a solid but not spectacular D/ST that finished eighth a year ago in fantasy points. This isn't the best matchup, but a home game against an offense with a lot of moving pieces compared to last season isn't the worst option either.",null,"One of several young backs contending for exposure in a somewhat murky Jacksonville backfield, Robinson enters this division matchup with the Colts as a deep-league stash."],"2":["A pair of scores -- one on the ground and the other in the air -- salvaged an otherwise blasÃ© opener for Kamara as he averaged a paltry 1.3 yards on 12 carries to go along with five catches for 51 yards against an improving Tampa Bay defense. Kamara should be more productive in Week 2 as he draws a more generous Raiders unit. As always, feel free to start your fantasy first rounder with confidence.","Hopkins found immediate chemistry with his new QB, Kyler Murray, hauling in an incredible 14 passes against a tough 49ers defense. Expect more of the same in Week 2 against a less-impressive Washington pass defense. Consider Hopkins to be a top-tier option heading into Week 2.","Evans was a game-time decision for Week 1 and, although he played, it was clear the star wideout wasnâ€™t 100%. Adding to the misery was that he still drew coverage from Marshon Lattimore. The end result was just one catch, albeit for a late touchdown. Another week to get better should serve Evans well as Tampa Bay gets ready to face a weak Panthers defense in the Buccaneers' home opener. Despite Week 1's performance, if Evans is active for Tampa Bay, he should be active for you.","When healthy, Thielen is one of the most dependable wideouts in the NFL -- and he proved that again in Week 1. He hauled in six of his eight targets for a pair of scores and a healthy yardage total. He'll get a chance to do the same in Week 2 against a Colts defense that allowed three Jaguars passing touchdowns to open the 2020 season. Lock him in as a WR1 for this week.","Philip Rivers often flirts with the league lead for targets to running backs, so it was fun to see Taylor targeted on six of his 12 routes in Week 1. It took an injury to Marlon Mack to unleash Taylor as the team's leading rushing option going forward, but there is undeniable upside for this gifted rookie against a Vikings defense that struggled in Week 1. ","While Prescottâ€™s Week 1 performance wasnâ€™t terrible, a consensus top-five fantasy quarterback is expected to give you more than just 266 yards passing and only one touchdown. Week 2 should be an improvement as he will take the helm against a Falcons secondary that just allowed Russell Wilson to have a 322-yard, 4-TD day. Despite the lackluster opener, Prescott remains one of the top fantasy QB options .","Mostert handled the bulk of the work at running back for the 49ers in Week 1 -- a great sign that 2019's breakout star might actually get a healthy workload this season and become a fantasy mainstay. He was especially effective in the passing game, so if George Kittle misses any time due to injury, we could see Mostert chip in even more as a pass-catcher in Week 2. Either way, he's a rock-solid option as an RB2 even against a Jets team that was solid against the run a year ago, though not to a concerning degree.","Some optimistic indicators emerged from Diggs' debut with Buffalo; not only did he deliver a solid eight-catch showing, but he promisingly led the team in air yards per target, as well. This signals some big yardage outings could be on the way. The Dolphins claim some real talent at outside corner, but Diggs' featured role figures to sustain a solid floor.","Shepard caught an efficient six balls on six targets, but for only 7.8 yards per reception, demonstrating he was primarily used as an underneath receiver. That said, this is nothing new to Shepard and his consistency is useful in leagues with PPR scoring. Consider Shepard to be a solid flex option, albeit with limited upside, when the Giants visit Chicago in Week 2. There, they'll be taking on a Bears defense that allowed the fourth-most total yards in Week 1.","A strong showing from Henry fueled by seven targets and 36 yards after the catch against the Bengals indicates he's firmly in the starting tier at the position for this matchup with a Chiefs secondary that struggled against tight ends dating back to last season.","Murrayâ€™s rushing workload was a bit higher than last seasonâ€™s average number of weekly touches, but his yards-per-carry was a middling 3.2, compared to 4.4 for 2019. He also saw just one unsuccessful target sent in his direction. There will be weeks when Murray is a deep flex option, but this isnâ€™t one of them.","Rodgers was able to find his connection to Davante Adams early and often to begin the new season, and he helped lead the Packers to a prolific day on offense to open the campaign. Meanwhile, the Lions were allowing three touchdown passes to Mitchell Trubisky and seem to have some injury issues in the secondary. This all sets up well for a vintage Rodgers performance in Week 2. He's a solid option to start in most fantasy leagues.","Buoyed by a pair of interceptions off Tom Brady -- including one returned for a touchdown -- the Saints were one of the better fantasy defenses in the opening week. Week 2 presents them with a battle against an improving Raiders offense. Let's consider the Saints D/ST to be one to start only if you don't have another (better) alternative. ",null,"Ninety scrimmage yards in his debut as the team's primary rusher is an impressive feat for Robinson. With 56 of his rushing yards coming after initial contact, Robinson proved capable of navigating a solid NFL defense. The Titans allowed 4.4 yards per carry this past week, with Robinson positioned as a daring flex play this week. "],"3":["Kamara was the chief beneficiary of Michael Thomas' absence on Monday night with 22 touches for 174 yards-from-scrimmage and a pair of rushing touchdowns. Kamara was especially productive as a receiver and is in a good spot to do so again against Green Bay in Week 3. Kamara is matchup-proof with a good chance to be the No. 1 overall running back in Week 3.","Hopkins took a step back in Week 2, \"only\" scoring one touchdown on nine targets, eight of which were caught. Through two weeks, the former Texans star has at least double the receptions, targets and yards of any other Arizona pass-catcher. He remains the top option in an offense on the rise under second-year passer Kyler Murray. Against a porous Detroit defense, Hopkins is an elite WR1 for Week 3.","That's more like it! After playing with a sore hamstring in the 2020 opener, Evans showed no ill effects in Week 2 with a 104-yard effort on seven catches, including a score. A repeat is possible with the Buccaneers facing the Broncos, who have surrendered the ninth-most WR receiving yards to go along with four touchdowns. Several wide receivers are in a favorable spot this week, landing Evans in fantasy WR1/WR2 range.","When your quarterback completes only 11 passes, it's not often a wide receiver will have a great day from a fantasy perspective. Thielen hauled in only three of his eight targets in Week 2 and suffered alongside the rest of the Minnesota offense. There are no guarantees that the Vikings offense will suddenly be better in Week 3, but the Titans did allow a healthy bit of passing from the Jaguars last week. If Jacksonville can do it, so can the Vikings. Consider Thielen as a WR2 for Week 3.","Joining Marshall Faulk, Edgerrin James, Dominic Rhodes, James Mungro, and Joseph Addai as the only rookies in franchise history with at least 25 carries, 100 yards and a score in a game, Taylor is now the unquestioned leader of the Colts' ground game. The Jets have surrendered the seventh-most fantasy points to backs this year, with Taylor primed for a big outing.","Last week, Prescott authored an amazing comeback against the Falcons where he threw for 450 yards and accounted for four scores -- including three rushing touchdowns. The 27-year-old signal-caller could be in line for another big day, facing a Seahawks defense that has given up the most yards through the air of any unit so far. Don't expect a repeat of the rushing heroics, but Prescott should absoltuely find paydirt through the air in Week 3.","The 49ers suffered quite a few injuries this weekend, and Mostert was among them. His injury isn't expected to be of the season-ending variety, but he's almost certainly out for Week 3. If he plays, lock him into your lineup as an RB2 against the Giants. Otherwise, look to Jerrick McKinnon as San Francisco's top back.","In his second career road game with at least 150 yards, Diggs connected with Josh Allen on a whopping five throws of at least 15 air yards. Thriving as the top option in a fun Buffalo passing game, Diggs next faces a challenging matchup with a solid Rams secondary. Given the awesome workload thus far with Josh Allen, Diggs is a solid WR2 candidate.","Shepard had to leave last week's game early due to turf toe and is questionable for this weekend, pending an MRI. Expect him to have to miss at least a week. If he's somehow able to go, the 49ers do boast a strong pass defense, likely to cause some issues for Daniel Jones. In or out for the Giants, Shepard should be a fantasy no-go for Week 3.","Busy as a security blanket for rookie passer Justin Herbert in Week 2, Henry is arguably the safest receiving threat on the team given his rapport with both of the team's quarterbacks. It also helps Henry's case that the Panthers struggle in coverage at safety.","Even without Michael Thomas in the lineup, Murray totaled only five touches in Monday night's affair. Barring an injury to Alvin Kamara, Murray is a fantasy non-entity.","It wasn't quite the \"vintage\" Aaron Rodgers performance we saw in Week 1 against Minnesota, but the Green Bay quarterback performed well in Week 2 and has avoided interceptions in both of his first two weeks of the 2020 season. The Saints have allowed plenty of production through the air over the first two weeks, so Rodgers makes for a solid, low-end play with some upside against New Orleans.","The Raiders had success both running and throwing the ball against the Saints on Monday night as Las Vegas christened Allegiant Stadium with a 34-24 victory. This week, New Orleans faces another balanced unit with Green Bay coming to the Big Easy. The Saints defense can generate turnovers, but they're also very likely to give those fantasy points back in yards and points allowed. With a full slate from which to choose, there are better units out there.",null,"A strong second half saw Robinson rumble for 85 of his 102 rushing yards, while also securing his first career rushing score. With a waning role on third downs in this one, Robinson is starting to look more like an early-down force than three-down threat, but it's still notable that this undrafted gem should handle at least 15 touches against an exploitable Dolphins defense."],"4":["Through three weeks, Kamara leads all running backs in yards from scrimmage (438), receptions (27) and touchdowns (6). Kamara usually does most of his damage running routes out of the backfield, but since the Lions have allowed the third-most RB rushing yards, he may enjoy a better game as a ball carrier. Nevertheless, at the end of Week 4, Kamara should keep his place as the top fantasy running back over the first quarter of the season.","No player in the NFL has more targets, receptions or yards than Hopkins, who will be a must-start every week this season as long as he's healthy . The touchdowns haven't been there yet, with only one in three games, but that will come around for the veteran wideout. Start him with confidence against Carolina.","It was a curious day for Evans as Tom Brady threw for 297 yards but only connected with Evans twice in Week 3, both for one-yard scores. While Evans' volume is likely to increase, in Week 4 he draws a tough Chargers secondary. Even so, Evans remains an automatic start, this week in the WR2 range.","Quite worryingly, Thielen has seen only 10 total targets over his past two games, hauling in only six of them for 60 yards. He does have a score over that span, but this is not the level of production we've come to expect from the Vikings' top receiver. Houston has allowed the 11th-fewest WR fantasy points this season, so it all adds up to a lackluster outing for Thielen in Week 4. That said, his track record suggests he'll bounce back sooner or later -- and he's too good not to start. ","Not yet truly a three-down force with Nyheim Hines still consuming a sizable share of snaps, Taylor is still impressively the lead early-down threat for the Colts. This role proves more valuable considering the Bears are allowing a generous 4.9 yards per carry to backs on the season, eighth most in the NFL. ","After three weeks, Prescott leads the league in passing yards, compiling 922 of them over the last two games. Next up is a date with a Cleveland defense that kept Dwayne Haskins Jr. in check last week, but gave up 591 total passing yards (with six combined touchdowns) to Kyler Murray and Joe Burrow to open the season. As such, Prescott remains one of the top options at the QB position for Week 4.","Mostert's health will be the deciding factor for his fantasy value in Week 4. If he's able to go against the Eagles, he's a must-start in fantasy given his great start to the season. Just keep an eye on the injury reports and have a backup plan ready.","If his quiet week for the Bills includes a touchdown and nearly 50 yards, then maybe the floor is really quite high for Diggs in Buffalo's thriving offense. Even as some regression hits this offense, Diggs remains a valuable fantasy option given such a rewarding rapport with Josh Allen. The Raiders have been solid against the pass, but Diggs' role is proving invaluable.",null,"Solid usage as Justin Herbert's security valve this past weekend saw Henry earn seven targets and a good bit of work between the numbers. The Buccaneers have allowed just 8.6 fantasy points per game to tight ends, but Henry's consistent target share helps offset the matchup issue.","If Murray doesn't score a touchdown, he isn't going to rack up enough production to be a fantasy consideration. So far in 2020, he's yet to reach the end zone. The Lions have only allowed two running touchdowns, but they have given up 146.3 RB yards per game, likely making Murray a bigger part of Sunday's game plan. Hopefully, you can find someone better, but this is the rare matchup to think about Murray as a flex in deep leagues.","Is the old Aaron Rodgers back? Not quite, but his performances this season have been more than startworthy from a fantasy perspective. With nine passing touchdowns in three games, he'll carry plenty of momentum into a matchup with the Falcons, who have allowed the most points to opposing passers so far in 2020. Rodgers is a must-start for Week 4.","The Saints defense has given up the 12th-fewest yards but the fifth-most scoreboard points. They aren't especially adept at forcing turnovers or sacking the quarterback. After a promising opening week effort, they've fallen into fantasy mediocrity, not worth starting even against a mediocre Lions offense.",null,"A career day from scrimmage included two touchdowns in Week 3, as Robinson has emerged as the early waiver wire or late-round steal of the season. Things look good this week, as well, with Robinson primed for a big role facing a Bengals defense that has allowed the sixth-most fantasy points to backfields. "],"5":["You know the bar is set pretty high when 23 touches accounting for 119 yards from scrimmage and a rushing touchdown is \"just another day.\" Kamara's effort helped keep him as the RB fantasy points leader. Kamara is in line for a big day coming out of the backfield in Week 5 as the Chargers have allowed the fourth-most RB receptions this season, with two going for scores.","Hopkins overcame a less-than-ideal injury outlook to play on a team-high 54 snaps in Week 4, but with the Cardinals' passing game gaining only 133 yards in total, his numbers weren't that impressive. Nevertheless, he had nine targets --matching his lowest total in any single game this season, but still very impressive overall. He will face a middle-of-the-pack Jets defense in Week 5. Start him with confidence.","Evans gritted out an ankle injury to post 122 yards on seven catches (including a score) in Sunday's come-from-behind victory. He was noticeably hobbled throughout the contest and, with the quick turnaround to Week 5's Thursday night affair, he's questionable to play against the Bears. The tough matchup drops Evans down to the WR2 level, but it's imperative to pay attention to the injury reports heading into the early-week contest.","In Week 4, Thielen hauled in a season-high eight passes on a season-high 10 targets against Houston, which is a good sign heading into a matchup with the team that's allowed the most WR fantasy points in 2020. Thielen is a great WR1/WR2 in all formats against Seattle in Week 5.","A limited receiving role and heavy use of backup options curbs Taylor's fantasy floor and ceiling each week. The gifted rookie is still poised to handle around 20 touches behind a good line, so even as the Browns have allowed just 64 rushing yards per game and the 10th-fewest fantasy points to backs, Taylor is in a good spot to meet his projection.","With a career-best 502 yards against the Browns, Prescott has thrown for 1,424 yards over the last three games, to go along with eight touchdowns. Next up are the Giants, who are averaging just under 12 scoreboard points per game. Prescott won't likely be forced to air it out as much this week, but even so, he remains a solid QB1. Just don't expect him to carry your team like he has the previous three weeks.","Mostert might return to action in Week 5. If he does, he should return to your fantasy lineup immediately. He was off to a great start through two weeks and would face a Miami defense that's among the 10 most favorable RB matchups so far this season. Just pay attention to his status throughout the week before locking in those lineups.","Josh Allen went four-of-four targeting Diggs at least 10 yards downfield this past Sunday and is now 16-of-19 (84%) on those throws to Diggs this season. With Diggs thriving as an unquestioned No. 1 in Buffalo, he's in a great spot to produce against a Titans secondary allowing nearly 40 fantasy points per game to receiving corps.",null,"Serving a smaller role this past week due in part to the Bucs' rangy coverage linebackers, it's nearly impossible for Henry to overcome such a tough matchup with just three targets from Justin Herbert. The Saints have been gashed badly by tight ends this season, helping Henry's case as a solid starting option.","Murray had a productive game in Week 4, grinding out 64 yards on the ground with two scores and one catch for 19 yards. Murray is likely to record similar yardage numbers each week, including Monday night against the Chargers. However, his scoring plunges will be sporadic. As such, let someone else chase last week's production. It's too unpredictable.",null,"The Saints have allowed the sixth-fewest yards per game, keyed by a strong front that has held opposing runners to just 97.5 yards per game. They've also gotten after the quarterback with 10 total sacks. It's unclear if rookie Justin Herbert or Tyrod Taylor will be under center for the Chargers in their Monday night affair but, either way, New Orleans is one of the better D/ST plays in Week 5.",null,"The undrafted rookie continues to be one of the most reliable backs in fantasy, going over 100 total yards for the third straight game and collecting 21 total touches in Week 4. The Texans have been one of the five best matchups for opposing backs so far this season, so consider Robinson as a solid RB2 pick in all formats for Week 5."],"7":["Kamara comes out of the Saints' Week 6 bye looking to fortify his spot as the top fantasy running back in the game. A date with the Tampa Bay defense usually spells trouble as the Buccaneers allow a league-low 49 yards per game on the ground to running backs. On the other hand, they're soft against pass-catching backs, which plays into Kamara's strength. You made it through his bye, so don't forget to click Kamara back into your Week 7 lineup.","Hopkins struggled to produce on Monday night thanks in part to Kyler Murray's inaccuracy, but he still saw eight targets and broke out for a 60-yard reception that may have salvaged his week from a fantasy perspective. He's still one of the best wideouts in fantasy, and he'll next face a Seattle defense that's allowing the most WR fantasy points by a fairly wide margin. Hopkins is an elite fantasy option for Week 7.","Evans was quiet in Week 6, catching just two passes for 10 yards. He was also held without a touchdown for the first time this season. While Evans has been a red-zone favorite, his average depth of target (and, hence, his YPC) is down significantly from the prior two seasons. Evans may no longer be a WR1 with Tom Brady around, but he remains an automatic start. He should rebound in Week 7 with Brady forced to air it out more in a visit to Las Vegas.",null,null,null,"Mostert is injured yet again and appears to be set to miss a month (or more) with a high-ankle sprain. The star back for the 49ers will return eventually but, until then, look to Jerick McKinnon and JaMycal Hasty to lead the way out of the backfield for San Francisco.","His first season in Buffalo has resulted in Diggs producing at least 86 yards or a touchdown in each appearance so far. Now a trusted WR1 given such a great blend of usage and talent, Diggs should thrive against a soft Jets defense.","Shepard begins the week on the IR but hopes to be activated in time to suit up for Thursday's affair with the Eagles. If he's active, the Giants plan on working Shepard into 3-WR sets. As such, he isn't likely to generate enough production to warrant a start. Monitor his progress until his workload increases.","Second on the Chargers this season in receptions, routes, and targets, Henry is serving a steady and rewarding role for the team's talented rookie passer. This home matchup with a porous Jacksonville pass defense sets up well for Henry, who is right on the fringe of starting value at his position.","Murray entered the Saints' bye averaging 57 scrimmage yards per game through the first five weeks. He's obviously playing second fiddle to Alvin Kamara, but Murray has seen double-digit touches in four separate games this season. His solid floor makes him a flex option for those preferring reliability over upside, though Murray will find some difficulty against the Panthers and their league-best run defense.","Well, at least it can't get much worse than that, right? Rodgers had one of the poorest performances of his NFL career in Week 6, completing fewer than 50% of his passes, tossing a pair of picks and failing to find the end zone against Tampa Bay. This all comes after a red-hot start to the season. With a favorable matchup against Houston on deck, we're willing to give Rodgers the benefit of the doubt. Keep him locked into your lineups as a QB1 and expect a solid rebound in Week 7.","Despite only generating four turnovers, the Saints are actually one of the better defenses in the league. However, with Tom Brady making his first trip to the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in a Tampa Bay uniform, this isn't the best matchup for this D/ST. That said, coming off a bye and with an extra week to prepare, New Orleans in play as a D/ST. However, it's still worth checking to see if a unit with a better matchup is available.",null,"The results aren't always pretty, but Robinson's major role on this offense aids his weekly floor, such as last week's 52 scrimmage yards and a score. The Chargers have allowed 4.2 yards per rush, while Robinson is among the safer RB2 options given such a heavy workload each week."],"8":["With the Saints missing both Michael Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders in Week 7 against the Panthers, Kamara's already heavy workload was expected to increase. With those two high-profile teammates sidelined, Carolina could key more on Kamara, but it didn't faze him. Fantasy's top back ran 14 times for 83 yards along with capturing all eight of his targets for 65 more yards. Kamara will again be the focal point this week against the Bears. Even if Thomas and Sanders both return, count on Kamara for another big effort.",null,"Still noticeably hobbled with an ankle injury, Evans freed himself up just twice in Week 7 for 37 receiving yards. If he can get closer to 100% for this week's encounter with the Giants, Evans could see an uptick since Chris Godwin won't suit up. Evans has been one of the league's biggest fantasy disappointments, but he still checks in at WR3/flex territory.","The veteran receiver has scored in all but one game this season -- and that scoreless game came against the elite Indianapolis defense. The Minnesota offense is far from great, but it's good enough to sustain a decent amount of production for Thielen most weeks. Green Bay is above-average at preventing opposing receivers from scoring fantasy points, but not enough to move Thielen off of WR1 status.","A great game in the receiving phase against the Bengals a few weeks back saw the rookie compile 115 scrimmage yards. With Nyheim Hines still a factor on third downs, however, Taylor hasn't been consistently solid for fantasy purposes. This week presents a nice matchup for Taylor to get really untracked, as Detroit has allowed more than 29 fantasy points per game to backfields.",null,null,"Found at third in targets and fourth in yardage through his first seven outings with the Bills, Diggs' debut season in Buffalo has been an unequivocal success. Even in last week's ugly outing for the Bills' offense, a dozen targets helped secure a solid fantasy floor for the star wideout. A challenging matchup with Stephon Gillmore awaits, but Diggs seems up for it.","In Week 7, Shepard made his presence felt early and often in his return from a four-game absence, catching 6-of-8 targets for 74 yards in last Thursday night's loss to the Eagles. Next up is another prime-time affair against the Buccaneers on Monday night. The Tampa Bay secondary has allowed the seventh-fewest WR fantasy points per game, landing Shepard in WR3/flex range.","Only connecting on three of his seven targets this past week, Henry was still on the field for more than three quarters of Justin Herbert's dropbacks in Week 7. A positive correction is likely due for Henry in working with Herbert, thus he's a solid starter against a Denver defense that has allowed nearly a dozen fantasy points per game to tight ends.","Murray notched a typical performance in Week 7 against the Panthers, rushing 11 times for 47 yards while successfully handling his only target for nine yards. Murray has only found the end zone twice this season, both in Week 4. Minimal contributions as a pass-catcher and the unpredictability of touchdowns limit Murray's fantasy potential, especially this week. The Bears have yielded just six rushing scores in seven games.","The Buccaneers must be legit on defense, because Rodgers immediately rebounded with a vintage performance in Week 7 against the Texans and now has 17 touchdowns and 0 interceptions in five games against all opponents not hailing from Tampa Bay. That trend should continue this week against the Vikings, who are hovering around the bottom 10 in the league at preventing opposing quarterbacks from scoring fantasy points. The Vikings allowed Rodgers to hang over 30 fantasy points on them to start the season. Rodgers is a must-start QB1.","The Saints continue to be a solid fantasy D/ST with their only blemish being a low turnover total. That could change this week facing a mistake-prone Chicago offense. Start New Orleans with confidence.",null,null],"9":["With the Saints missing receivers Michael Thomas, Emmanuel Sanders and Marquez Callaway in Week 8, their offense needed Kamara to contribute even more in the passing game. He delivered by securing 9-of-13 targets for 96 yards in addition to grinding out 67 yards on the ground with a dozen carries. Week 9 presents a stiff challenge with New Orleans heading to Tampa Bay for a rematch of their Week 1 clash. That said, Kamara is obviously matchup-proof.","After a bye week to rest his injured ankle, Hopkins should be even better for Week 9 (and beyond) than he has been throughout the first half of the season. His volume is as consistent and impressive as any receiver outside of Davante Adams and Michael Thomas, and he will be a solid WR1 option in all leagues against a good, but not great Miami defense.","Evans snapped a two-game scoring draught with an eight-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter of Tampa Bay's Monday night, 25-23 win over the Giants. Evans found paydirt at least once in each of the first five games before finally returning to the end zone in Week 8. Scoring prowess aside, with Antonio Brown looming as a new addition to the Buccaneers' WR corps, Evans registers as no more than a WR3 for this week's Sunday night showdown with New Orleans.","The Vikings hardly needed to pass in Week 8 with Dalvin Cook running all over the Packers and, as a result, Thielen had his worst outing of the season by all measures. This week's contest against the Lions provides an easier matchup, but the risk of the Minnesota passing game being inefficient or irrelevant is still there. He's still a starter in all leagues, but more of a risky WR2 than a rock-solid WR1.","Jordan Wilkins led the backfield in snaps and yardage this past week after Taylor struggled to get untracked. A diminishing role was apparently due to an ankle injury, per the coaching staff, but it was concerning either way to see both Wilkins and Nyheim Hines produce stronger fantasy lines than this rookie. Now in the flex tier with the increased competition for work and this injury issue to consider, Taylor faces a Ravens defense that has allowed the third-fewest fantasy points per game to opposing backs.",null,null,"Even in a game that saw the Bills compile just 154 yards in the air, it was emboldening for Diggs' fantasy value that he was able to deliver a solid 92-yard showing. With at least six catches or a touchdown in every game this season, Diggs is a must-start option heading into a choice matchup with a Seattle defense allowing the most fantasy points per game to receivers in the league.","In Monday night's heartbreaking loss to Tampa Bay, Shepard recorded his best effort of the season, capturing 8-of-10 targets for 74 yards. While he's only played in the first two and last two games of the season, it's apparent that Shepard has a calming influence on QB Daniel Jones. Their chemistry keeps Shepard in the WR3 conversation for this week's trek to Washington for a Sunday night tilt.","The big plays aren't really surfacing as much as you'd like for Henry, but he's still running plenty of routes and is due for a bigger outing if for his snap and route rates. The Raiders present a solid matchup for Henry in that Las Vegas has allowed more than 11 fantasy points per game to tight ends, right around his projection for this matchup.","Murray did very little while spelling Alvin Kamara during Week 8's overtime win in Chicago. He carried the ball just eight times for 17 yards, though he did snag a season-high three balls for an additional 14 yards. Sadly, Murray remains a fantasy non-entity.","The RB situation in Green Bay is looking precarious heading into Week 9 against San Francisco, which means the team will need to rely on Rodgers more than ever. Aaron Jones is still recovering from injury, while AJ Dillon and Jamaal Williams will miss the game due to the league's COVID-19 protocols. The 49ers do not offer a great matchup for opposing passers (11th-fewest QB fantasy points per game allowed), but that's not enough to downgrade Rodgers. Trust him as your QB1 for Week 9.","You might want to risk using the Saints D/ST against Tom Brady as he sets his sights on becoming the No. 1 fantasy scorer in the history of the game, but I'm not really sure why.

Look for another huge week as Robinson should have his way with a Texans defense allowing the sixth-highest RB fantasy points per game."],"10":["Game flow hindered Kamara's workload in the Saints surprisingly easy 38-3 shellacking of the Buccaneers in the Week 9 Sunday night showcase. Kamara still managed 40 yards on nine rushes including a score along with an unusually low five catches for just nine yards. Look for Kamara to return to a larger workload as the Saints take on the 49ers in Week 10.","Hopkins had his worst fantasy output of the season in Week 9, handling only three targets and picking up 30 yards with those three catches. Christian Kirk was the star of the show, and Kyler Murray otherwise spread the ball around, completing a pass to nine different Cardinals. We have no reason to believe this is a long-term change in offensive philosophy but rather just an outlier game for the veteran receiver, and we trust him as a top wideout in Week 10, even against a strong Buffalo pass defense.","After being shut out in the first half of the Buccaneers demoralizing 38-3 loss to the Saints, Evans enjoyed a busier second half, grasping four of six targets for 64 yards. Playing alongside Chris Godwin, Antonio Brown and Rob Gronkowsi hinders target share, but it also frees up coverage enough for Evans to be a WR3/flex option in Tampa Bay's Week 10 date with the Carolina Panthers.","The Vikings threw only 20 passes in Week 9, and Thielen was the target on just five of those. Dalvin Cook was able to carry the offense against a pair of weak run defenses, so Kirk Cousins kept the ball out of the air. That might change this week against a tougher Chicago defense, and Thielen is due for a rebound. Consider him a WR2 option against a tougher matchup -- which might actually benefit him as the Vikings might be forced to throw more often.","A costly fumble that resulted in a touchdown return marked the rookie's first turnover in 105 career carries. After that costly fumble, Taylor was on the field for just a dozen of the team's 51 remaining plays. The Titans have allowed 4.5 yards per carry to backs, 12th most in the league, but Taylor's recent struggles results in flex value for the rookie this week.",null,null,"Able to secure all eight of his catchable targets in Week 9, per Pro Football Focus, Diggs' incomparably consistent debut season with Buffalo continues. Realistically pacing for 112 catches and more than 1,400 yards as Josh Allen's top target, Diggs is undoubtedly busy and talented enough to overcome this looming matchup with Arizona's Patrick Peterson.","Shepard's upside is limited, toiling for the Giants low-octane offense, but since returning from a four-game absence in Week 7, he's become a volume play, seeing at least eight targets with six or more catches in each of the last three contests. Week 9's ledger includes a 19-yard dash on top of six receptions for 39 yards. Shepard checks in as a WR3 in Week 10, facing a middle of the pack Philadelphia pass defense.","Held below 40 yards in each game since Week 3, Henry has yet to really connect with gifted rookie passer Justin Herbert. A positive sign is that Henry continues to earn steady route and target rates, suggesting some bigger lines are possibly on the way. This week Henry nets a meeting with a Miami back seven allowing just 9.6 fantasy points per game, in line with his projection this week.","With a 31-0 halftime lead in their Week 9 trouncing of the Buccaneers, the Saints were happy with playing ball control for the second half, calling on Murray for an increased workload.

Game script of this nature is impossible to predict, so Murray remains nothing more than a flex play in deep leagues when the Saints entertain the 49ers in Week 10.","Apart from a surprising loss to the Buccaneers, Rodgers has been a top fantasy option every week this season and should remain as such against the struggling Jacksonville defense. The Jaguars are allowing the third-most points per game to opposing passers, making Rodgers one of the top options in all formats for Week 10.","Nick Mullens may have played a strong game under center for the 49ers in their Week 9 loss to the Packers, but this week he has to contend with the Saints D/ST, one of the top units in the league.

Kamara was his usual effective self as a receiver, catching seven balls for 83 yards and a third score. Even without Drew Brees at quarterback in Week 11, Kamara remains a top fantasy option, with New Orleans facing the porous Falcons defense.","In what could be the play of the year, Hopkins soared to grab a 43-yard desperation launch from Kyler Murray, using the best hands in the game to secure the ball amid three defenders. For the season, Hopkins' 9.8 YPT is on pace to set a new career-high. Hopkins has a chance to improve on that mark even more as the Cardinals take on the Seahawks and the league's worst pass defense in Week 11's Thursday night affair.","In Week 10, Evans continued his knack for finding the end zone with his eighth TD reception of the year. The score highlighted a 6-catch, 77-yard performance in a convincing win over Carolina. Week 11 will be a challenge as the Rams and Buccaneers hook up in this week's Monday-nighter. Evans checks in as a WR3 as the Rams are the league's top defense against wide receivers.","In Week 10, Thielen continued a string of modest catch and yardage totals, snagging four balls for 43 yards. However, two of his receptions were of the scoring variety, and the recevier notched his eighth and ninth TD catches for the season. Thielen's knack for scoring keeps him in the WR2/WR3 range for this week's encounter with a vulnerable Cowboys secondary.","A promising rookie campaign has devolved into a fruitless committee role for Taylor, evidenced by earning just 13 rushes and four receptions across the past two weeks while veteran teammates deliver stronger showings. It seems we're at the point of the season where it would take a strong game from Taylor against the Packers' porous rush defense this week for him to vault back into lineups next week. Which is to say, given his recent lack of work, it's fine to sit Taylor for this week if viable options are available.",null,null,null,null,"Securing his second score of the season this past Sunday, Henry finally surfaced as a helpful fantasy contributor after weeks of quiet lines.

They've surrendered the fourth-fewest yards from scrimmage per game along with the eighth-most sacks per contest. The Saints defense is still \"all systems go\" for Week 11, especially as they're hosting this NFC South battle.",null,"Robinson added to his top rookie resume in Week 10, eclipsing the century mark for the third time as he tallied 109 rushing yards on 23 carries (along with a pair of catches) in Jacksonville's loss to Green Bay. With three straight games of 20-plus carries, Robinson is Jaguars' clear No.1 back. Week 11 poses a challenge against the Steelers and the league's top run defense, but the freshman's volume still lands him in low-end RB1 territory."],"12":["For the second time in three weeks, Kamara failed to surpass 50 yards from scrimmage as his production was limited to 45 rushing yards on 13 carries, though he did find the end zone. With another week to try and develop some chemistry with replacement-QB Taysom Hill, Kamara's usually heavy involvement in the passing game could return. He's still an obvious start when the Saints travel to Denver for their Week 12 tilt, but it will be interesting to monitor Kamara's usage.","In Week 11, Hopkins had one of the more disappointing outings of the season from a fantasy perspective, failing to post big numbers against a Seattle team allowing the most WR fantasy points per game. It's hard to imagine him remaining in a slump for long, though, and against a more average New England defense, it's time to expect a rebound outing. Lock in Hopkins as your WR1.","Despite lining up against Jalen Ramsey for most of Week 11's Monday night showcase, Evans still managed five catches for 49 yards -- featuring a nine-yard score as he carried two defenders into the end zone. On another team, Evans would generate WR1/WR2 numbers, but amid a stacked Buccaneers' WR corps, it's prudent to expect production only in the WR3 range, especially since Week 12 brings with it a Kansas City defense allowing the fourth-fewest WR fantasy points per game.","Thielen has been placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list and his status for this week's game against the Panthers is in doubt.","The Colts' backfield carousel keeps spinning, as Taylor surprisingly regained a major role in the offense in last week's big win over Green Bay. The rookie's role has waned in prior weeks, but he was fed 26 touches and delivered a strong line. The Titans are up next in a key division showdown, with Taylor positioned as a flex option thanks to this recent surge in work. ",null,"Mostert could return to action in Week 12 for the 49ers, which would be a welcome sight for both coach Kyle Shanahan and fantasy managers alike. San Francisco has really struggled in recent weeks and there might not be a lot of fantasy upside on this offense, but Mostert was a fantasy star early this season. He would deserve an RB2/flex spot in most leagues, if healthy.","Enjoying an awesome debut season with the Bills, this target magnet delivered his fourth game with at least 20 fantasy points in Week 10's battle with the Cardinals. This looming matchup with a strong Chargers' secondary isn't likely to stop Diggs from getting his this weekend.","Shepard has been solid in his four games since returning from shoulder and toe injuries. After already missing four starts earlier in the season, he was likely anxious to keep playing, but the Giants had a Week 11 bye. Look for Shepard to pick where he left off in Week 12, facing a Bengals secondary allowing the fourth-most Wr fantasy points per game.","With scores in consecutive games for the first time this season, Henry enters this upcoming meeting with Buffalo with real momentum. The Bills have been gashed by tight ends throughout the season, evidenced by allowing the third-most fantasy points per game to the position. ","Murray had his most productive game of the season in New Orleans' Week 11 win over Atlanta, rushing for 49 yards on 12 carries while catching two passes for 36 more. Murray has had a consistent role in the Saints offense, but with Alvin Kamara garnering the lion's share of snaps, Murray remains out of the fantasy mix when the Saints visit the Broncos on Sunday.","While the interceptions in back-to-back outings are certainly strange for Rodgers, his consistent production ever since a shocking letdown against the Buccaneers in Week 6 is on brand for the veteran signal-caller. The Bears have one of the better pass defenses in the NFL and allow under-15 QB fantasy points per game. Still, Rodgers is a must-start unless you're fortunate enough to have another top-10 passer on your fantasy roster.","The Saints D/ST sets up as one of the top plays on the Week 12 slate with New Orleans heading to Denver to face Drew Lock and the Broncos. Lock has only been sacked 11 times, but he's thrown 11 picks on the season to go along with just seven TD passes.",null,"Another strong scrimmage showing was especially impressive this past week, as Robinson nearly hit 100 total yards against a stingy Pittsburgh defense. One of the rare backs with such a robust weekly workload, Robinson can overcome this tough matchup with the Browns this week."],"13":["For the second straight week with Taysom Hill at the helm, Kamara was absent from the Saints' passing game, but at least there was a reason for the dearth of targets in Week 12. New Orleans was ahead the whole game and never in danger of losing to Denver. Kamara did run for 54 yards on 11 carries in the lopsided affair. While it's fair to be concerned about the recent trend, Kamara should be more involved in Week 13, with a prime matchup against the Falcons' generous defense.","Hopkins has slowed down (along with the rest of the Arizona offense), but there's no reason to give up on the star wideout. The Rams do offer one of the toughest WR matchups in football, allowing the fewest fantasy points per game to the position. Still, with seven-plus targets in all but one game this season, Hopkins is a must-start in all leagues regardless of opponent.",null,"Thielen is expected to be activated from the reserve/COVID-19 list for Week 13, and he'd come back to a great matchup against a struggling Jacksonville defense. He's had his ups and downs this season, but for the most part, the veteran receiver is a reliable source of fantasy output and should be locked into your lineups if he's cleared to play against the Jaguars.","The absence of Taylor contributed to the Colts producing just 56 rushing yards in Week 12, the team's lowest tally since Week 15 of last season. With the Texans yielding the most fantasy points per game to backfields among AFC defenses this season, Taylor's potential for a strong return is real. ",null,"Mostert returned to action in Week 12 and immediately reminded everyone why he was worth holding onto during his injury absence. The Purdue product scored a touchdown while handling 18 touches to lead the 49ers to a victory over a tough Rams defense. Against a much weaker Buffalo defense, consider Mostert as a safe RB1 in all formats and leagues.","The efficiency wasn't there in Week 12, but the volume was, as Diggs still netted nine targets in a tough matchup with the Chargers this past week. With another heavy workload lined up for Diggs, he's in a spot to again overcome a tough matchup in Week 13.","Shepard captured 7-of-8 targets for 64 yards as the Giants tamed the Bengals in their Week 12 encounter. Shepard next faces a Seahawks defense yielding the most fantasy points per games to receivers. If Daniel Jones starts, Shepard should be active. However, he's a but banged up. If Colt McCoy gets the nod instead, Shepard falls to flex range.","Season highs in targets and receptions helped Henry produce a respectable fantasy showing for the third straight week. Extending this streak to four games could prove challenging given the Pats have allowed the fifth-fewest fantasy points per game to tight ends, but Henry definitely enters with some notable momentum.","Murray was the primary beneficiary of the wacky circumstances surrounding the Saints' Week 12 trouncing of Denver. The Broncos were forced to play without an experienced quarterback, allowing New Orleans to grind it out. Murray carried the ball 19 times for 124 yards and a pair of touchdowns. With the Saints next traveling to Atlanta for a Week 13 rematch (New Orleans won in Week 11), Murray should return to his backup role, with little fantasy allure.","As his letdown performance against the Buccaneers in Week 6 is looking more and more like an outlier as time passes, Rodgers has returned to the upper echelon of fantasy quarterbacks this season. He has proven to be quite matchup-proof as well, with back-to-back solid outings against elite pass defenses from Indianapolis and Chicago. That means a matchup with a decent Eagles secondary shouldn't scare you off. Lock in the veteran signal-caller as your QB1 in all leagues for Week 13.","The Saints defense sacked practice squad WR-turned-QB Kendall Hinton once and intercepted him twice in Week 12's dismantling of Denver. The New Orleans D/ST will be challenged far more by the Falcons in Week 13, but their season-long excellence warrants a start in all formats.",null,"Robinson added to his NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year bonafides with a productive Week 12, rushing 22 times for 128 yards including a four-yard scoring plunge. He also added five receptions for 31 more yards. Robinson, who was signed as an undrafted free agent, is one of the few \"three-down backs\" in the league. He'll put his RB1 status on display this week when the Jaguars head to Minnesota in their Week 13 encounter."],"14":["Kamara entered Week 13's contest with only one reception in the two games with Taysom Hill at the helm. While he only caught two more balls in the Saints' victory over Atlanta, he did ramble for 88 rushing yards on 15 carries, including an impressive 37-yarder and an 11-yard TD burst. Kamara's involvement in the passing game is likely to remain low until Drew Brees returns (possibly in Week 14), but he's still an automatic start regardless of who is taking those QB snaps.","Hopkins has finished with between 51-55 yards receiving for three straight games now -- a byproduct of an Arizona passing game that has lost some explosiveness as Kyler Murray has faced tougher matchups and is potentially dealing with a lingering shoulder injury. Either way, Hopkins is still a red-zone threat and a consistent target all over the field. He gets more than enough volume to stay in your lineup against a mediocre Giants secondary.","With two more TD grabs in Week 12, Evans now has a total of 11 for the season, good for the fourth-highest total in the league. The Buccaneers emerge from their bye with a Week 14 visit from the Vikings. Predicting touchdowns is generally a crapshoot, but with a Minnesota secondary allowing the second-highest number of passing scores per game, Evans is in a great spot to add to his total.","Thielen returned to action with a flourish in Week 13, hauling in yet another touchdown and catching eight passes (on 11 targets) for the second-straight game. Against a Tampa Bay defense much weaker against the pass than the run, he'll be an important part of the Vikings' plans in Week 14. He should be a key part of your fantasy lineup, as well.","Finally serving as the team's featured option out of the backfield, Taylor thrived in both phases this past week against Houston. The Raiders have been one of the most generous teams in the league facing backfields, setting up Taylor for a strong outing as the fantasy playoffs begin.",null,"Mostert split time with Jeff Wilson Jr. on Monday and, with the 49ers needing to throw the ball almost 40 times while chasing the Bills, the star running back struggled to get anything going. San Francisco is always going to rotate backs in and out of the game, but Mostert is the most talented option on the roster. He is the one you want to trust heading into this week's tough matchup with Washington, a football team that is among the five most difficult RB fantasy opponents. He's an RB2 with a decent floor, but limited upside given the strong opposition. ","Surpassing 1,000 yards this past Monday in a big prime-time win, Diggs' awesome debut season has been driven by both efficiency and volume. This coveted equation supports a strong projection for Diggs this week, even as the Steelers remain a solid pass defense.","Fill-in QB Colt McCoy targeted Shepard six times, but they were only able to hook up once for 22 yards in the Giants' Week 13 upset in Seattle. Next on the slate is a Week 14 visit from the Cardinals and a secondary allowing the 10th-most WR fantasy points per game. Shepard's production is limited in a low-potency offense, but his volume and the favorable matchup land him in WR3 territory.","After earning at least six targets in four straight games entering Week 13, Henry was held to a season-low two targets in the bad loss to New England. The Falcons have allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to tight ends on the season, a matchup trend that serves Henry well as a starting option this week.","With Taysom Hill more comfortable in the pocket and Alvin Kamara picking up chunk yards on the ground, Murray's Week 13 involvement waned considerably. In fact, he had only five carries for 17 yards -- his lowest scrimmage output for the season. Week 14 lines up as another lesser effort with New Orleans visiting Philadelphia. The Eagles have yielded the 10th-fewest RB fantasy points per game, relegating Murray to reserve status.","That scoreless game against the Buccaneers in Week 6 keeps looking weirder and weirder, huh? Rodgers delivered another big fantasy point total against a tough Eagles defense in Week 13 and he'll get a much easier matchup this week against the Lions. He's arguably the top QB option for Week 14 and belongs in each and every lineup where he's available. ","The Saints continue to be one of the top defenses in the NFL, yielding the second-fewest yards from scrimmage per game while also sitting fourth in sacks per game. The New Orleans D/ST is one of the top plays on the Week 14 slate for their trip to Philadelphia, as Carson Wentz is expected to give way to rookie Jalen Hurts under center for the Eagles.",null,"Sound the alarm -- a tailback other than Robinson touched the ball this past week for the first time since Week 9. Actually, that's really a great sign of Robinson's amazing consolidation of the team's backfield usage, with this rising rookie continuing to produce RB1-worthy outcomes. The Titans were gashed on the ground by Nick Chubb this past Sunday, setting up Robinson for another solid showing."],"15":["Kamara's presence in the Saints' passing game returned in Week 14 as he caught 7-of-10 targets for 44 yards on top of a productive day on the ground (11 rushes for 50 yards and a score). The Saints will be looking to bounce back from their 24-21 loss in Philadelphia when they entertain the Chiefs in one of Week 15's top matchups. Kamara should be in line for another big day in what could be a high-scoring affair.","In Week 14, Hopkins rewarded those who stuck with the superstar receiver, breaking out for more than 100 yards against the Giants. His stats have been trending up in recent weeks and, with his best matchup in a long while this week against a Philadelphia secondary that struggles to handle receivers, he's an easy choice to utilize as a WR1 in all formats.","With Tom Brady only putting the ball up 23 times in Week 14, Evans had just three catches -- but for a team-high 56 yards -- in Tampa Bay's win against Minnesota. The Buccaneers now head to Atlanta for a Week 15 showdown. Evans is a must-start against a Falcons secondary allowing the second-most WR fantasy points per game. Still, keep expectations in check as Brady likes to spread the ball around.","The Buccaneers got to Kirk Cousins early and often in Week 14, which had the biggest fantasy impact on Thielen, who had his worst outing in over a month. The veteran was covered well enough to see only four passes thrown his way, but there's no reason to make a drastic move after one poor showing. Even against a tough Chicago defense, keep Thielen in your lineup, as he scored twice the last time these teams met. ","Taylor's 62-yard rushing score last Sunday marked the team's longest play from scrimmage this season. The raring rookie reached 21.4 mph on his long run, the fastest speed by a Colts player on any rush over the last three seasons. With real momentum and a solid workload working in his favor, Taylor is peaking at the perfect time to face Houston, the league's worst rush defense.",null,"Just as he was getting back into a rhythm, Mostert suffered yet another injury and his status for Week 15 is in question. When healthy, he has enough upside to merit a start in fantasy in any matchup. That's especially true against a Dallas team that's among the most favorable opponents for running backs in fantasy. That said, keep a close eye on his health, since the 49ers have several other backs they can deploy if Mostert is out.","Becoming just the second player in franchise history to post at least 100 catches in a campaign -- joining Eric Moulds' 2002 opus -- Diggs has been electric in his first season with Buffalo. The Broncos' solid pass defense isn't fearsome enough to depress Diggs' projection this week, as his rewarding rapport with Josh Allen often overcomes such matchup-driven metrics.","In Week 14, Shepard was quiet for the second straight game, handling just 3-of-5 targets for 35 yards as Daniel Jones struggled to find a groove in the Giants' loss to Arizona. Shepard remains Jones' primary target but with uneven quarterback play, Shepard can't be trusted in Week 15 when Cleveland visits.","A real lack of big plays and red zone attention has left Henry with a relatively quiet season, albeit last week at least included six receptions. The Raiders have allowed the 12th-fewest fantasy points to tight ends on the year, with Henry at the back end of the starting tier of tight ends.","Game script did not favor Murray in Week 14 as he was on the field just 20 times, his third-lowest total this season. He garnered five touches for just seven yards. Ouch! While Murray's output will likely increase in Week 15 against the Chiefs, it still lines up to be well below what's necessary for a fantasy lineup.","Rodgers has been an elite fantasy option all season long, and that should continue in Week 15 against a struggling Carolina defense that just allowed four touchdowns to Drew Lock. The 37-year-old is a \"set it and forget it\" signal-caller. Lock him into your lineup this week with confidence and then keep him there through the end of the season.","The Saints defense had a rare misstep in Week 14's surprising loss to the Eagles. They'll look for retribution against the prolific Chiefs offense in one of the best games on the Week 15 docket. The matchup isn't favorable, but the New Orleans D/ST has been too productive to bail on them at this point of the season.",null,"Getting down big to the Titans last week served to curb Robinson's workload, as he was averaging just over 21 carries in his prior six games entering Week 14, but netted just 12 totes in the loss. A 47-yard run helped deliver a solid day from scrimmage for the undrafted breakout fantasy star, while he could return to a busy role facing a Baltimore defense that ranks right around league average in fantasy allowance to tailbacks."],"16":["With Drew Brees back at the Week 15 helm, Kamara rushed 11 times for 54 yards and also caught three balls for 40 yards -- including his first scoring strike since Week 10. As always, Kamara is one of the top options in Week 16 as the Saints host the Vikings on Friday.","Hopkins has been thriving in recent weeks with Kyler Murray looking closer to 100%. He has seen double-digit targets in three straight contests and posted a dominant performance last week against the Eagles. The first time Hopkins faced the 49ers this season, he ran wild for 151 yards. Even though San Francisco has solid defensive metrics, there's no reason to move Hopkins out of your starting lineup for this one.","In Week 15, Evans surpassed the 100-yards receiving plateau for the first time since Week 4 and just the third time this season. He notched 110 yards on six receptions in Tampa Bay's victory over Atlanta. Evans lines up for another productive afternoon on Saturday when the Falcons head to Motown. The Lions have served up the seventh-most WR fantasy points per game, placing Evans in WR1/WR2 territory.","Thielen posted his lowest yardage total of the season in Week 15 and tied a season-low with just two catches. However, one of those grabs was a touchdown, which helped cover for an otherwise lackluster outing. The Saints are a tough defense to beat and the Minnesota passing game has been lacking of late, but Thielen still has sufficient upside to merit a start as a WR2/WR3 in most leagues.","A league-winning surge from Taylor has seen him score a touchdown in three straight. A healthy workload can now be projected for Taylor each week, setting him for success against a Steelers front that just allowed multiple touchdowns to Giovani Bernard.",null,"Mostert suffered yet another injury in Week 15 and he is now done for the season due to a high-ankle sprain.","Now with a franchise-record three straight games with at least 10 catches, Diggs' 111 catches this season are the most in a single season in Bills history. A brilliant debut campaign continues this week against the rival Patriots, a team that Diggs tallied 92 yard against several weeks back.","With Colt McCoy under center, Shepard caught four balls for 51 yards in Week 15 as the Browns downed the Giants. Week 16 presents a road tilt against the Ravens, where Shepard is, at best, a flex option in deep formats.","Injuries to Mike Williams and Keenan Allen opened up a bigger workload for Henry in Week 15, earning him a team-leading seven targets and his first touchdown in the past four outings. With at least seven targets in four of the past five games, Henry enters Week 16 with some momentum. The Broncos have allowed the ninth-fewest fantasy points to tight ends on the season and held Henry in check in their first meeting, but few tight ends claim as steady of a workload as Henry at this point.","Murray was only on the field for 16 snaps in Week 15, tying his season-low. However, he did mange to reel in his first TD reception of the season in the contest. Still, that's not enough to move the needle. Murray remains a fantasy non-factor.","In Week 15, Rodgers finished with fewer than three total touchdowns for only the third time this season while also posting his lowest yardage total of the campaign. However, a matchup with the Titans (who rank among the worst pass defenses in the NFL) is a perfect rebound spot for the veteran passer. If you're still in the running for your fantasy league with Rodgers under center, you have to start him with confidence in this pivotal week of action.","Despite yielding 30 scoreboard points to Patrick Mahomes and the potent Kansas City offense in Week 15, New Orleans remains one of the premier D/STs in the league. Look for a rebound this week when the Vikings march into the Superdome for a special Friday afternoon extravaganza.",null,"An ankle injury in the final quarter of Week 15's loss to the Ravens forced Robinson to the sideline and puts his status for Week 16 in question. Robinson was able to produce a respectable fantasy result this past week thanks to a receiving score, but a tough upcoming matchup with the Bears and this injury issue means fantasy managers will want to be prepared with alternatives just in case. "],"17":["So, what is he going to do for an encore? Kamara obviously won't repeat his historic Week 16 effort, but he's in a good spot for a typically solid performance with the Saints still firmly in the running for the NFC's best record. Carolina's defense has allowed the eighth-most RB fantasy points per game this season.","Both Hopkins and his quarterback, Kyler Murray, will be fighting off injuries as they prepare for a must-win matchup in Week 17 against a stalwart Rams defense. If you have Hopkins, he has to be in your lineup, since he has seen 10-plus targets in each of the last four games. That said, his upside might be limited thanks to the tough matchup and the injuries with which he and his teammates are currently dealing.","With 181 yards on a season-high 10 receptions in Week 16, Evans cleared the 100-yard plateau for the fourth time this season. He also added his 12th and 13th touchdown catches. With the Buccaneers playing for a higher playoff seed and the generous Falcons secondary visiting Tampa Bay in Week 17, there should be no hesitation in using Evans this week.","Thielen rebounded from a pair of lackluster outings by collecting more receptions, yards and targets in Week 16 than he did in the two previous games combined. He'll have one final chance to pad his stats for the season against a Detroit team that's among the best WR fantasy matchups in the NFL. He's a must-start in all leagues.","Only Antonio Gibson has scored more rushing touchdowns among rookies this season than Taylor, as this Wisconsin product has now delivered five scores during the past three weeks. Poised for a strong finish to a strong rookie season with a choice matchup against the Jaguars, Taylor is a certifiable RB1 option this weekend.",null,null,"A monster Monday night effort saw Diggs score three times and reach 120 receptions for the Bills this season, marking the most ever by a veteran player in his first year with a new team. Diggs produced a season-high 153 yards against the Dolphins earlier this season, evidence he's a must-start option for the finale.

The Giants entertain the Cowboys in a regular-season finale where both teams have a shot to stumble into the NFC East title with a win and a Washington loss. The Giants' passing offense is erratic, but Shepard checks in as a flex play since the Cowboys secondary is one of the weakest in the league.","A spot on the COVID-19 reserve list kept Henry out of action this past week. If he's able to return to the field this week, Henry could enjoy a nice role with Keenan Allen limited and the Chiefs resting key members of the back seven","Iin Week 16, Murray posted his second-best game of the season. For the day, Murray carried the ball 12 times for 72 yards to go along with three catches for another 24 yards. He could once again see an increased workload in Week 17 as the Saints will look to pound the ball against the Panthers, but he's too risky to trust for fantasy purposes.","If you're still playing for something in Week 17 and have Aaron Rodgers, you know what to do. Not even a tough Chicago pass defense should scare you away from the elite veteran quarterback, who dropped four scores on the Bears the last time these teams met.","Despite allowing 33 scoreboard points to the Vikings in a Week 16 blowout victory, the Saints defense continues to be one of the league's top units. With a chance at the NFC East's best record still in play, the New Orleans D/ST is again one of the top fantasy plays for Week 17. The unit will face an erratic Teddy Bridgewater and the Carolina Panthers.",null,"An ankle injury suffered in Week 15 kept Robinson off the field for the first time this season in Week 16.

That's actually good news for Hopkins, who broke out of a yards-per-catch slump in Week 5 and found the end zone for only the second time this season. His volume makes him a WR1 every week regardless, but his performance against the Jets and a matchup in Week 6 with Dallas makes him a particularly good choice for the week ahead.","Evans continues to be Tom Brady's favorite red-zone target as the wideout tallied his sixth scoring strike of the season in Week 5's Thursday night affair. He's tied with Adam Thielen for the most 2020 TD receptions. Evans has been playing through a sore ankle and should benefit from the extra time off between games. With the relatively soft Packers defense on tap, Evans is a borderline WR1 for Week 6.","Thielen scored twice in Week 5. It was his second multi-score game of the season and his fifth and sixth touchdowns overall. No matter how the Minnesota offense is doing, the veteran wideout seems to make an impact in the passing game. Especially with Dalvin Cook out and the offense needing a boost, lock him in against the Falcons' pass defense, which has allowed a league-high 15 touchdowns thus far in 2020.","Save for his debut, Taylor hasn't topped two targets in a game since and has played fewer than 60% of the team's offensive snaps in three straight weeks. Taylor should eventually deliver some big games on the ground even if the team won't leverage him in the receiving phase. This week could bring on one of those big lines, as Taylor faces a choice matchup with a Cincinnati front allowing 5.3 yards per carry to tailbacks, third most in the league.

The prognosis is for a 4-6 month recovery which should be in time for him to begin preparation for the 2021 campaign. That said, what remains unknown is whether or not he'll be in Dallas as Prescott's current contract expires at the conclusion of the 2020 season.","Mostert returned to the 49ers lineup -- and to his normal level of production, going over 100 total yards even in a lopsided loss. He's a must-start running back when healthy given San Francisco's preference towards backs and tight ends. Lock him in as a solid RB2 against the Rams in Week 6.","A rewarding role as Josh Allen's top target has treated Diggs well so far this season. He's among the league leaders in several key receiving categories, most notably as one of the best in plays of at least 20 yards. A big challenge awaits Buffalo's top threat, as the Chiefs have allowed just the fifth-fewest fantasy points per game to receivers.

is coming off an up-and-down 2019 campaign, but the 24-year-old remains the main man in the New Orleans' backfield. Kamara missed a pair of games but otherwise played a similar role to 2018, handling 12.2 carries and 7.0 targets per game. Kamara ended the season with a YPC above 4.5 and exactly 81 catches for the third consecutive season. A lack of usage near the goal line (7.1 OTD, 6 TDs) limited his fantasy production, though he did finish strongly with four of those scores coming during Weeks 16-17. Kamara should have little trouble pushing for 20 touches per game in the Saints' Drew Brees-led, high-scoring offense. He remains a solid RB1.","Hopkins was traded to the Cardinals during the offseason and will now operate as Kyler Murray's go-to target. A top-five fantasy WR in four of the past five seasons, Hopkins has averaged 10.5 targets per game during that span, which is a mark he should still be able to approach with Arizona. Murray is far from a finished product, but the Cardinals' offense finished 2019 strong with three-plus touchdowns in eight of their final 11 games -- and that was without one of the game's best receivers. At age 28, Hopkins remains an elite fantasy option and should be selected near the first/second-round turn.","Evans returns as Tampa Bay's top perimeter wide receiver. However, for the first time since his rookie season in 2014, Jameis Winston won't be his primary quarterback. That may not seem ideal after Evans put together four consecutive seasons as a top-17 fantasy WR, but it's very possible that the 26-year-old's efficiency and consistency will actually improve with Tom Brady in town. Evans has ranked near the top of the league in aDOT and YPR throughout his career, but near the basement in both catch rate and RAC. That has led to inconsistent production, including 2019, when 53% of his fantasy point total for the season came during just three games. Even if the big plays are down a bit, Evans will see enough volume and goal-line work (he's never finished lower than ninth in end-zone targets) to reach his third top-10 fantasy campaign.","Following the offseason trade of Stefon Diggs to Buffalo, Thielen enters 2020 as the Vikings' clear-cut top target. Thielen missed six games because of injury last season, but was previously extremely reliable, having not missed a single game during his first five seasons. A top-10 fantasy WR in both 2017 and 2018, Thielen sat ninth prior to his Week 7 injury in 2019. Thielen turns 30 this year and Minnesota's run-heavy offense will limit his ceiling, but he's a safe bet for a generous target share and thus, a high fantasy floor. Grab him as your WR2.","The Colts surprisingly nabbed Taylor with the 41st pick of April's draft. An outstanding prospect purely from a rushing standpoint, the Wisconsin product paced this year's rookie class in carries, rushing yards and rushing touchdowns and ranked fourth with a 3.7 YAC in 2019. Taylor also crushed it at February's combine, running a position-best 4.39 40 and a solid 7.01 three cone despite a hefty 5-foot-10, 226-pound frame. The main concerns here are fumbles (18) and pass-catching ability (nine drops on 68 targets). Taylor has RB1 upside down the road, but his short-term fantasy value will suffer with incumbent early-down back Marlon Mack and passing-down specialist Nyheim Hines in the fold. Taylor is worth grabbing in the middle rounds, but it might take some time before he's a reliable fantasy starter.","Prescott will be back under center for Dallas following his best professional season in 2019. Prescott ranked no lower than sixth among quarterbacks in pass attempts (596), completions (388), passing yardage (4,902), passing touchdowns (30), yards per pass attempt (8.2) and average depth of throw (9.4) -- all while dealing with a league-high 30 drops. Also a factor as a rusher (52-277-3), Prescott finished a career-best second at the position in fantasy points. Armed with a terrific line, as well as WRs Amari Cooper, Michael Gallup and CeeDee Lamb, Prescott should be considered a solid QB1 option.","It's not often you see a running back break out in his fifth NFL campaign, but Mostert did exactly that down the stretch last season. Primarily a special-teams player throughout his career, Mostert put up 859 yards and scored 13 touchdowns on 133 touches during the 49ers' final nine games of 2019 (including the playoffs). An extremely efficient runner, Mostert is averaging 6.0 YPC on 178 regular-season carries for his career, which is easily best among 188 RBs with 150-plus carries. The concerns here are that Mostert plays a minimal pass-catching role (22 targets last season) and Kyle Shanahan is very unpredictable with his backfield rotation. As such, Mostert is best viewed as a flex with RB2 upside.","Diggs was traded to Buffalo during the offseason and will now operate as the Bills' top target. The 26-year-old posted a trio of top-25 fantasy campaigns during his final three seasons in Minnesota, but now moves to a low-volume, run-first Buffalo offense led by the inefficient and scramble-heavy Josh Allen. That figures to lead to a decrease in production for Diggs, which is a concern considering he was only the WR24 last season -- despite Kirk Cousins' extremely efficient campaign and with Adam Thielen sidelined. Diggs, who has never appeared in all 16 games of a regular season, is likely to be over-drafted and is best viewed as only a WR3.","Shepard has been a tricky player to figure out so far. The 2016 second-round pick has finished two seasons among the top-eight WRs in routes run, but he's also missed five-plus games in two different seasons and he's yet to finish any season better than No. 30 in fantasy points. Shepard replaced Odell Beckham Jr. as the Giants' No. 1 WR last season -- and he was very busy, handling six-plus targets during all 10 appearances. Only five other players can say the same. Shepard's efficiency was poor, but the volume allowed him the 17th-most fantasy points during those 10 weeks. Shepard will have more competition with a healthier group around him this season, but he's still a legitimate candidate to lead the team in targets. Don't sleep on the 26-year-old when flex hunting.","Henry is back with the Chargers after the team applied the franchise tag during the offseason. The team's 2016 second-round pick has yet to play a full 16-game season, missing all of 2018 and a total of seven games the other three seasons. That includes four in 2019, though Henry was productive enough when active to produce his first top-10 fantasy campaign. Henry has finished top-10 in YPT in all three of his NFL seasons and has been a force near the goal line, with 17 touchdowns and 25 end zone targets in 41 games. Henry's durability woes and the departure of Philip Rivers are concerns, but the 25-year-old will still be a back-end TE1 option when active.","Murray is now 30 years old, but he remains in a good spot as Alvin Kamara's backup in a high-scoring Saints' offense. In his first season in New Orleans, Murray was held to 98 touches and the 49th-most fantasy points among backs during the 14 weeks Kamara was also active. However, with Kamara sidelined during Weeks 7 and 8, Murray stepped in and racked up 307 yards and four touchdowns on 60 touches. He was fantasy's top-scoring RB in that span. Murray lacks stand-alone value but is obviously an elite insurance option.","Once a perennial top-two fantasy QB, Rodgers has settled in as more of a mid-to-back-end QB1 in recent seasons. That included 2019, which saw him finish ninth in fantasy points even though he appeared in all 16 games and ranked eighth in pass attempts. Rodgers' efficiency has been a culprit, as he hasn't finished better than 16th in YPA since 2014 after previously dominating the category. He also hasn't cleared 26 pass TDs in a season since 2016 and is no longer much of a factor with his legs. Rodgers has Davante Adams, Aaron Jones and a solid line at his disposal, but the 36-year-old is no longer an elite fantasy weapon.","The Saints' D/ST finished eighth in fantasy points last season and has now produced a pair of top-10 campaigns over the past three seasons. New Orleans has finished top five in sacks each of the past two seasons and came in average or better in interceptions, forced turnovers, yardage allowed and points allowed during both campaigns. The team's offseason departures (Vonn Bell, Eli Apple and A.J.

The good news is that he added 50 receptions and three receiving scores -- and that's where his value truly lies. Much like Alvin Kamara and similar do-it-all backs, Sanders is going to build up a solid base of points each week with receptions and yards, occasionally finding his way into the end zone. Plenty of upside remains for more scoring and a truly great season. That starts with what should be an RB1 performance in Week 1 against Washington.","Godwin and teammate Mike Evans are both poised for big seasons with Tom Brady at the helm of the Tampa Bay offense. The fourth-year pro out of Penn State broke out last season and established himself as one of the best in the league. He'll start Week 1 as a top target for Brady in what should be an exciting offense to watch. Start him in all formats.","Ridley has provided a solid secondary option to Julio Jones in his first two seasons with Atlanta, but could a breakout be on the way? It's hard to say, as Todd Gurley II should help keep pressure off of the passing game, but Matt Ryan is only getting older and Julio Jones is still as good as ever across from Ridley. That said, you'll take his contributions even if there is no breakout, and he's a solid WR3/flex in Week 1 against a mediocre Seattle pass defense.","A chronic knee ailment limited Gurley in 2019, but he still managed to find the end zone 12 times. Now a member of the Falcons, he'll likely see his workload managed. Still, he's the best back on the Atlanta roster and figures to get any fantasy-friendly touches in the red zone. Seattle allowed the 13th-most RB points a year ago, making Gurley a solid RB2 for his Atlanta debut.","A freshly signed extension should keep Allen with the Chargers for a long time. The target magnet could prove especially busy in Week 1 against a patchwork Bengals secondary with Mike Williams ailing. Expected to earn a huge share of the team's passing offense, Allen enters the season as a high-floor fantasy threat.","Jones has plenty of talent sitting behind him on the RB depth chart but, heading into Week 1, he seems to be the lead back for the Buccaneers. Tom Brady has always been able to bolster his backs with good receiving stats, and Jones is a capable pass-catcher, so he's a name to watch among backs who might not have been taken too early in your draft. The Saints had one of the 10 best defenses against running backs last year from a fantasy perspective, but Jones is still worthy of a flex spot in your Week 1 lineups.","A gifted vertical playmaker who has struggled to stay on the field in his career, the huge batch of targets left by DeAndre Hopkins could spell a breakout season from Fuller. The Chiefs were solid against receivers last season, but like a prime DeSean Jackson, it only takes one or two big plays for Fuller to produce a big fantasy line.","Contending with a compelling rookie talent for early-down usage could eventually limit Ingram's presence as a safe fantasy option, but to start the season, it appears the proven veteran will command a valuable majority of rushing opportunities. Having posted a healthy 6.3 yards per tote last season against a poor Cleveland rush defense, Ingram is poised for a solid opener.","Some dazzling collegiate yards-after-the-catch and elusiveness in addition to positive buzz from this preseason have Moss entering the season with some helium as a fantasy prospect. The Bills are projected to deploy a nearly even share for work between Moss and Devin Singletary, making it tough to trust this rookie in lineups against a Jets front that was stout against the run last season.","A fantasy force at his best in Carolina, injuries have cut short his past two seasons. In a new offense and years removed from being regularly productive, there is certainly some risk in streaming Newton in lineups to open the season. Working in his favor is the fact the Dolphins allowed 21.4 fantasy points per game to signal-callers last season and struggled to contain rushing quarterbacks. If Newton is still a dominant rushing presence, this could be a fun debut.","The loss of awesome playmaker Derwin James is a big blow to this defense, but a pair of elite edge rushers and a deep secondary helps Los Angeles enter Week 1 as a worthy streaming option. The Bengals have an exciting young team led by Joe Burrow, but there is also some real fantasy potential in facing a rookie making his first start.","Howard isn't likely to disappear just because Rob Gronkowski has arrived in Tampa Bay, but his upside is drastically diminished. A healthy Gronk means Howard should be on the bench in your fantasy league, but we've seen Tom Brady involve multiple tight ends before. Keep an eye on the Alabama product.","Fournette should immeditely find a role with the Buccaneers as a brusier back splitting time with Ronald Jones II. However, much like the Tom Brady offenses of old in New England, it's going to be tough to know which back will be worth a fantasy start in any given week. Fournette seems like the weakest link in the passing game on the Tampa Bay RB depth chart, though, which is a good reason to keep him sidelined in fantasy for Week 1.",null,"Last season, the Cardinals had one of the worst fantasy D/ST units, and scored zero fantasy points over two matchups with the 49ers. Avoid them in Week 1 against their divisional rivals."],"2":["Sanders was unable to go in Week 1 as a hamstring injury kept him on the sidelines. Thereâ€™s a strong chance heâ€™ll be ready for a good Week 2 matchup against a Rams defense susceptible to the run. Keep an eye on the injury reports. If Sanders is practicing in full, heâ€™ll be a high-end RB2 this week.","Tom Bradyâ€™s favorite receiver is usually the guy thatâ€™s open. That said, Week 1 did reveal that Tampa Bay's new quarterback trusts Godwin, as he had a team-leading seven targets, resulting in six catches for 79 yards. Of course, Mike Evans was hobbled most of the contest. Godwin will always be \"second fiddle\" to Evans, but that can also benefit his stats when a healthy Evans draws the opposing secondary's top cover man. With or without a healthy Evans, Godwin is a solid fantasy WR1 in Week 2 as Tampa Bay hosts Carolina's porous defense.","Ridley picked up where he left off last season as he was a top-five wide receiver from Weeks 11-14 before missing the rest of the year. He will be hard-pressed to match his opening week's nine catches for 130 yards and two scores, but so long as Julio Jones is drawing primary coverage, volume will be ample to keep Ridley firmly in the WR2 range. This week is no exception as Matt Ryan is likely going to be forced to keep pace with the Cowboys' prolific offense.","One of the reasons Atlanta signed Gurley was his prowess at finding the end zone. He paid dividends right away, scoring early, before the Falcons fell behind. That limited his second-half usage. Gurley will again be the early-down and goal-line back facing a Cowboys defense without LB Leighton Vander Esch, who fractured his collarbone in Week 1. Gurley's yardage production could again be limited by game flow, but he still ranks as an RB2 due to his proclivity for scoring touchdowns.","A forgettable first outing left Allen with just 37 total yards thanks to a modest 68 air yards in the game. The Chiefs don't claim top coverage talents at cornerback, so the hope is that a rewarding rapport between Tyrod Taylor and the newly-paid Allen will surface.","Even after Leonard Fournette was brought on board, Jones was still listed as the Buccaneers' No. 1 running back -- and the snap distribution seemed to confirm that as Jones led the backfield with 32 plays in the huddle. With 17 carries and two catches, Jones touched the ball more than 50% of the time he was on the field. Fournette may eventually eat into Jonesâ€™ playing time, but that's no guarantee. Facing a defense that allowed 139 total yards to Josh Jacobs last week renders Jones as a solid RB2/flex option for Week 2.","Living up to the hype in his supercharged role as the team's vertical playmaker, Fuller not only lead the Texans with 14.1 air yards per target in Week 1, he produced 73 more yards than any of his teammates in the loss. With the potential to be Deshaun Watson's top target going into this difficult matchup with the Ravens, Fuller is a solid flex option.","Without any real role in the passing phase, Ingram's role was limited to early downs in Week 1. Worse yet, rookie J.K. Dobbins consumed and converted valuable goal-line touches, leaving Ingram with a quiet line. This is simply a one-game sample, but a lack of receiving and goal-line equity going forward wouldn't be ideal for Ingram's fantasy stock. This said, he's still expected to be the team's backfield leader and is in the flex tier for this week's tilt against a Houston front that struggled to contain the Kansas City backfield last week.","At just 2.3 yards per touch in his first game, Moss wasn't efficient, yet his performance was promising thanks to converting a goal-line touch into a score in his debut. Moss could repeat his workload from last week of a dozen touches, which clearly outlines some risk. Then again, at least the opponent is inviting and his potential for a touchdown elevates given his success in high-leverage work in Week 1.","All Newton did in his first start with the Patriots was produce more carries, yards, yards after contact, and touchdowns than any of his teammates. His 15 totes mark the most even by a Patriots quarterback in a game and the most rushing yardage since Steve Grogan in 1977. Which is to say, Cam was Cam. The Seahawks don't have a shutdown defense at this stage, while Newton's fantasy floor is now quite high given such a vintage rushing performance.","Joey Bosa is a boss and this team's deep secondary somehow appears poised to prove dangerous without Derwin James. This all said, it's nearly impossible to trust any defense facing Patrick Mahomes and his deep and dangerous crew of skill players.","Despite playing on a limited 37 snaps, Howard lead the talented Tampa Bay TE corps with four receptions on six targets, scoring once. It remains to be seen how the workload ultimately sorts itself out, but with Rob Gronkowski getting more acclimated every week, Howard may have already had his best performance of the season. Barring an injury to Gronkowski, Howard remains unrosterable.","Fournette was on the field for only nine plays, carrying the ball five times for just five yards while securing his only target for 14 yards. His role could grow as he becomes more familiar with Bruce Ariansâ€™ system. As it currently stands, though, let someone else roster the name brand.",null,"Washington may have won in Week 1, but that victory wasn't based on a particularly strong offensive performance (239 total yards). It might be tempting to add the Cardinals to your fantasy lineup as a result of their prime matchup, but remember that this is a unit which has struggled to generate turnovers and sacks -- crucial elements in the fantasy point formula for D/STs. With three sacks and no takeaways in Week 1, it doesn't seem like the Cardinals are quite ready to be a starting D/ST in 2020."],"3":["After sitting out Week 1 with a sore hamstring, Sanders began his sophomore campaign with a strong effort, gaining 95 yards on 20 carries, including a touchdown -- plus three catches for 36 yards. Week 3 could be even more productive as the Eagles face a Bengals defense that has been carved up for 358 yards on the ground so far, the most in the league through two weeks. Sanders has top-five RB upside this week.","Good news for those with Godwin on their roster as he's set to return to action, having cleared the league's concussion protocol. While he had to miss last week's date with the Panthers, this is a good week for Godwin to come back. The Broncos defense has allowed a hefty 560 yards and four touchdowns to wideouts in the first two games of the season. As such, the fourth-year wideout regains his customary high-end WR2 status.","Not only has Ridley been the Falcons' top wideout, he's the No. 1 overall fantasy receiver so far in 2020. The Falcons' proclivity for throwing the ball will keep Ridley's output high, but expect a dip facing a tough Bears defense in what should be a lower-scoring game than Atlanta's first two affairs. Even a healthy Julio Jones won't keep Ridley from borderline WR1 status.","Even with Atlanta's pass-happy attack over the first two weeks, Gurley has only been targeted five times -- and all in the first game. He's still getting running volume and is the primary goal-line option, but this week will face a Chicago team that's allowed only three total touchdowns over the first two weeks. Gurley's workload keeps him as an RB2, but his upside is limited unless Atlanta starts using him more as a receiver out of the backfield.","A strong, volume-driven showing in Week 2 might prove to be an outlier if the offense reverts to the conservative approach of Tyrod Taylor. Then again, Allen is so consistently open that he can work well with either arm, especially against a subpar secondary such as Carolina's.","Week 2 looked to be favorable for Jones and he came through early with a first-quarter touchdown. However, as the game progressed, it was Leonard Fournette who received the bulk of the playing time. With both backs healthy, Bruce Arians is probably going to ride the hot hand -- with Fournette looking like he may overtake Jones on the depth chart. The reduced workload drops Jones to no more than a Week 3 fantasy flex in deep formats.","Apparently dealing with a hamstring injury throughout the game, Fuller didn't see a single target on his 22 routes in Week 2. After a breakout Week 1, this was quite the crash for Fuller. The Steelers are up next and have actually been somewhat generous to receivers, helping Fuller's case if he's good to go this week.","An awesome trick play saw Ingram deliver a touchdown to help boost an otherwise mediocre output in Week 2. It's become clear the Ravens will apply a committee approach from the backfield. That said, Ingram is still the name to trust from this backfield given goal-line duties and his ability to break a big play. It also helps that the Chiefs have allowed nearly 27 fantasy points per game to backs this year.","Moss tallied 37 scrimmage yards in Week 2. It appears unlikely the rookie will help much in the receiving phase, meaning he'll need to do damage around the goal line to factor in fantasy. The Rams present a solid matchup for backs, but Moss just isn't in a good enough role to trust in lineups.","Fresh from his 40th career game with both passing and rushing scores, extending his own NFL record, Newton now has five career games with at least 40 passing attempts and 10 rushing attempts; no other QB since the merger has more than two such outings. Back to being a productive rushing threat, Newton is a strong fantasy play against the Raiders this week.","A respectable effort against the Chiefs revealed how deep and talented this Chargers defense proves. Now facing a Carolina offense without much firepower, this D/ST claims real potential to provide rewarding results.","With Leonard Fournette doing most of the damage in a ball-control game, and Mike Evans handling the bulk of the receiving work when needed, there wasn't much left for Howard. He saw just three looks in Week 2, resulting in only one reception for 11 yards. Depending on your free-agent and waiver rules, it may not be worth carrying two tight ends. Howard can easily be a drop option if you're looking to free up roster space.","Game script favored Fournette last week and he took advantage by eclipsing the century mark on the ground in his second game with Tampa Bay. He finished with 103 yards and two rushing touchdowns, along with four receptions for another 13 yards. Ronald Jones is still listed ahead of Fournette on the Buccaneers' RB depth chart, but it's looking more like a time share. Fournette projects as a RB2/flex against a tough Denver run defense.",null,"The Cardinals have looked great to start the season, including on defense, where they've allowed only 35 scoreboard points through two contests. They've yet to intercept a pass, but did force two turnovers against Washington and have seven total sacks this year. Detroit has been struggling out of the gate and, while this is all based on small samples, it might just be worth giving one of 2019's worst D/STs a shot in Week 3, given their recent history and a matchup at home against the Lions."],"4":["After missing the first week of the season, Sanders has since come through with 95 yards rushing in both of the last two weeks. He also has seen 15 targets, a number boosted by a depleted Eagles WR corps. Sanders should continue to see a heavy workload and could do some damage against a 49ers front that has endured several injuries. Sanders again registers as a low-end RB1.","Godwin was enjoying a solid game last week, catching five passes for 64 yards and a score before leaving with a hamstring injury. Unfortunately, Godwin is likely to be out this week and maybe more.","Ridley only caught 5-of-13 targets, but it was good for his third straight 100-yard game, even as he failed to score for the first time this season. Next up, Ridley lines up against a leaky Packers secondary that has given up seven touchdowns to wideouts. With or without Julio Jones active, Ridley is a solid fantasy WR1.","Gurley tallied a workmanlike 80 yards on 14 carries -- including a 10-yard touchdown -- but remains a nonentity in the passing game. That could change this week as the Packers have surrendered the third-most backfield receiving yards along with a healthy 4.9 YPC. Gurley's volume and his nose for the end zone render him as a solid RB2.","Eighteen targets is almost certain to deliver special results, with Allen's 13-catch Week 3 opus as evidence. If Justin Herbert remains behind center, this heavy concentration of targets to Allen could continue. The Buccaneers are allowing the 10th fewest yards to receivers, while Allen's rich target share helps offset such matchup woes. ","After playing second-fiddle in Week 2, Jones outpaced Leonard Fournette in Week 3's encounter with the Broncos. The two backs should continue to be in a time-share, though the majority holder in any given week will be a mystery. Unless he establishes clear dominance, Jones is nothing more than a deep flex play.","It was encouraging for his fantasy profile that Fuller led the team in routes and targets in a nice bounce-back showing after Week 2's no-show.  A strong average depth of target helps Fuller's potential for big plays against a Vikings secondary allowing nearly 47 fantasy points per game to receivers. ","A sizable downturn in snaps and touches versus last season has Ingram reliant on touchdowns to surface with any real fantasy value. No longer due for many touches, Ingram will need to prove very efficient to deliver fantasy value this week against an improved Washington defense. ","A toe injury kept Moss from the field in Week 3, so we'll want to see how the rookie handles practice this week. If he's good to go, Moss becomes a deep sleeper in that he could thrive against a leaky Raiders defense allowing the most fantasy points to backfields by a wide margin.","Las Vegas limited Newton to just 189 total yards (162 passing, 27 rushing), his fewest in a game this season. Fifteen of Newton's 17 completions traveled five-or-fewer yards in the air, marking the second-lowest average depth of target in a game in his career. Things will need to open up for Newton as he faces a high-scoring Chiefs team. Given what should be a demanding workload, Newton is a solid QB1 candidate.","Down to 19th in pressure rate and now with Melvin Ingram on injured reserve, the Chargers aren't in a great spot to defend a Tampa Bay offense that enters the week with some real momentum. Even with Joey Bosa and some talented corners, the absence of multiple playmakers from this D/ST has changed expectations. ","Howard will remain a weekly contributor to the Tampa Bay offense, but with Rob Gronkowski getting reacclimated to his long-time QB friend, Howard's numbers aren't likely to get better than Week 3's line of three receptions for 49 yards. That's not what you want from your fantasy tight end.","In Week 3, Fournette logged just one fewer snap than in Week 2. Unfortunately, he received just seven carries in the contest. It will take a crystal ball to discern how Bruce Arians will split the workload between Fournette and Ronald Jones in Week 4. If you're in the mood to roll the dice, Fournette can check in as a flex option against a stingy Chargers defense.",null,"After finishing last season at the bottom of the rankings, the Cardinals D/ST has exceeded expectations through three weeks. While they have yet to face a very difficult offensive matchup, that doesn't change in Week 4 against Carolina, a unit that ranks near the middle of the pack in yards (16th), points (9th) and turnovers (16th). Consider Arizona a low-end starting D/ST for Week 4."],"5":["In Week 4, Sanders had his least productive game of the season working against a depleted (but still stingy) 49ers front. He managed to gain just 76 scrimmage yards after averaging 119 yards over the previous two weeks. Week 5 presents another challenge as the Eagles fly across the state to visit the Steelers. Even so, the fact that Sanders is getting the lion's share of Philadelphia's backfield workload keeps him as a RB1/RB2 in the meeting of these Keystone State rivals.",null,"After eclipsing the century mark in receiving yards each of the first three games, Ridley was held without a catch for the first time since entering the league in 2018. He was targeted five times but drew frequent double-coverage after Julio Jones was forced out of the game just before halftime. Ridley has excelled in Jones' absence in the past and may be called upon to do it again facing a stingy Panthers defense. Ridley's explosiveness deserves a spot as a borderline WR1.","Gurley found paydirt on consecutive drives during Monday's prime-time affair, giving him four rushing touchdowns, tied for second-most in the league. He also accumulated 57 yards on 16 carries even as Matt Ryan continued to ignore Gurley in the passing game. Gurley's nose for the end zone meshes well with Sunday's opponent as the Panthers have allowed seven rushing touchdowns so far in 2020, landing him in RB2 territory.","Consuming nearly 40% of all the team's targets with Justin Herbert behind center, Allen's awesome market share with the rookie fuels a high fantasy floor. The Saints remain solid against receivers, but Allen's big slice of the pie keeps him in the WR1 club this week. ","With Leonard Fournette inactive and LeSean McCoy forced out of the game early, Jones assumed lead-back responsibilities in Week 4 and responded with 20 carries for 111 yards while also recording a season-high six catches for 19 yards. With Fournette questionable and McCoy doubtful to suit up on Thursday night, Jones should again see the lion's share of action against the Bears. Jones' increased usage in the Tampa Bay passing game could come in handy as Chicago's biggest defensive weakness is running backs coming out of the backfield. Consider Jones as an RB2 this week.","With consecutive games with a score for the first time in two years, Fuller even had a second score called back this last week upon review. A glaring lack of playmakers on offense beyond Fuller signals potential for even more work for this Notre Dame product in the weeks ahead. The Jaguars have been respectable against wideouts thus far, but Fuller's game-changing speed means he's a worthy fantasy starter.","We're officially entering touchdown-or-bust territory with Ingram. The good news? He's still in a pretty good spot to score touchdowns as the lead short-yardage back on Baltimore. The bad? He's truly in a four-headed rushing committee with his backfield peers and his quarterback. With the best touchdown equity of the backfield trio, Ingram is poised as a flex option facing a Bengals defense allowing 26 fantasy points per game to backfields, 12th most in the NFL.","Close to playing last week after getting in some practice work, Moss could suit up this week against a Tennessee defense allowing 139 rushing yards per game and the most yards per carry to tailbacks in the NFL. Given the choice matchup, Moss is a high-ceiling streaming candidate. ",null,"The Chargers' pick-six against Tom Brady was impressive in Week 4, but this group went on to give up tons of points to Tampa's offense. With modest pass rush rates so far, it's not exactly attractive to face a capable and quick-hitting Saints' offense.","Howard ruptured his Achilles in Week 4, abruptly ending his 2020 season.","Fournette missed last Sunday's contest with an ankle injury and was listed as a non-participant in Monday's walk-through in advance of the Thursday night tilt with the Bears. He's currently listed as questionable but, even if Fournette plays, it's best to look elsewhere for Week 5. At best, he'll be sharing carries with Ronald Jones II -- and Chicago is allowing just 115 yards per game on the ground.",null,"The 2019 Arizona D/ST returned in Week 4, forcing only a single turnover, picking up no sacks and allowing 31 scoreboard points to the Christian McCaffrey-less Panthers. This looks a lot like the defense that finished last in D/ST scoring a season ago. However, against the Jets in Week 5, there's upside, so they're worth a gamble as a low-end starting unit."],"6":["In Week 5,  Sanders ran for 80 yards on 11 carries, although one of those rushes was a 74-yard TD burst. Sanders also tallied an additional one-yard end-zone plunge along with securing two catches for 19 yards. Sanders' volume and explosiveness keep him as an RB1 option despite facing one of the toughest run defenses in the league as the Eagles host the Ravens in Week 6.","After sitting out practice the last two weeks while nursing a hamstring strain, Godwin was able to do some running early this week. It's a good sign that he'll be able to return to full practice and hopefully suit up on Sunday. If he's reported to be at (or close to) 100%, Godwin should return to the WR1 tier as he's shown good chemistry with Tom Brady when he's been on the field.","After failing to catch any balls in Week 4, Ridley eclipsed 100 yards receiving in Week 5, as he had done in each of the first three weeks of the season. He's in a great position to at least match those eight catches for 136 yards against a Vikings secondary yielding the fifth-highest average yards per game to wideouts. With or without Julio Jones in the lineup, Ridley is entrenched as a WR1.","Last week was a throwback game for Gurley as he ran for 121 yards on 14 carries -- including a first quarter 35-yard TD burst -- along with a season-high four receptions for 29 more yards. Next up is a Vikings defense sitting mid-pack in terms of RB fantasy points allowed. Gurley's TD-dependent nature and low usage in the passing game cap him as a strong RB2.",null,"In Week 5, Jones surpassed 100 yards for the second straight week, rushing for 106 on 17 carries. He also chipped in with three catches for 19 yards. The only shortcoming here is that Jones has found paydirt just once this  season. Even with the lack of touchdowns, Jones' volume as the clear No. 1 back for the Buccaneers places him as an RB2/flex for this week's meeting with a middling Packers defense.","Sent eight targets with an average of 15.5 air yards in Week 5, Fuller's rewarding downfield role continues to convert into fantasy fun. Leading Houston in air yardage for the season, Fuller's steady inclusion on high-value vertical looks keeps him firmly in the WR2 tier ahead of this meeting with a Titans secondary struggling to contain outside speed.","The veteran tailback handled another small workload in Week 5 thanks to a presence in just 30% of the team's offensive snaps. Ingram's value mostly stems from his steady role in high-value scenarios, such as his four snaps on goal-to-go plays this past week. This also leads to him being quite dependent on touchdown production, which can understandably prove volatile.","With Devin Singletary positioned as the team's busier back in regards to snaps and touches, Moss is tasked with maximizing a limited change-of-pace role. The value for Moss comes from his potential as a threat in high-leverage goal-to-scenarios. Moss was a surprise inactive in Week 5, but if he can play against the Chiefs, the matchup is good.","As long as he's good to go in Week 6, Newton should be busy moving around and outside the pocket against a Denver defense that just recently revived its pass rush. You know the deal with Newton; you bank on rewarding rushing production and hope he can complement his ground game with some success in the air against a depleted Denver defense.",null,null,"Fournette didn't practice prior to the Thursday night affair in Week 5 but was still active for the contest. However, he was on the field for just one play. Fournette is questionable again this week against the Packers. Even if he plays, Ronald Jones has established himself as Tampa Bay's top back. This puts a cap on Fournette's production, especially for fantasy purposes.",null,"The Cowboys have gained the most yards and scored the third-most points per game in the NFL this season. Unfortunately (for them), they also have the most giveaways and will be starting a backup quarterback in Week 6. Combine that with the Cardinals' up-and-down D/ST performances this season, and you have a high-risk/high-reward starting option for the week ahead."],"7":["Sanders has been ruled out of Thursday's prime-time affair with a knee injury. He's in danger of missing Week 8 as well.","In Week 6, Godwin was productive after a two-week absence, reeling in five of his seven targets for 48 yards. Look for Godwin's volume to increase this week as Tampa Bay visits Las Vegas on Sunday. Now injury-free, Godwin is a safe start in all formats.","In Week 6 against the Vikings, Ridley failed to surpass the century mark in receiving yards for just the second time this season, though he did haul in his first touchdown since Week 2. Look for the third-year wideout to match his most-recent output of reeling in 6-of-7 targets for 61 yards when Atlanta hosts the Lions. As such, Ridley remains in the WR1/WR2 range and is an automatic start.","Volume was there for Gurley in Week 6 as he toted the rock 20 times, but a season-low 2.4 YPC resulted in just 47 yards. In fairness, he was a bit more active in the passing game, catching three balls for another 20 yards. Gurley should see more running lanes this week, facing a Lions front that is allowing the fourth-most rushing yards per game. However, Gurley's consistently low usage as a receiver places him as no more than a high-end RB2.","A back injury cut short another potentially impressive outing for Allen shortly after he hauled in a touchdown in Week 5. With Allen enjoying a strong rapport with his rookie passer and with the gifted route-runner likely back in form against a Jacksonville secondary allowing roughly 170 receiving yards per game to wideouts, he's positioned as a solid WR1.","With 113 rushing yards on 23 carries in Week 6, Jones surpassed the 100-yard plateau for the third straight week, adding a pair of TD runs to go along with two receptions for eight yards. This week, Jones benefits from a favorable matchup as the Raiders have yielded the second-most RB fantasy points per game, cementing Jones as an RB2 even if Leonard Fournette returns.","Deshaun Watson's touchdown strike to Fuller in Week 6 traveled 52 yards in the air, the second-most on any completion of the quarterback's career. This big-play maven merits a spot in lineups for this meeting with a solid, but still exploitable, Green Bay secondary.",null,"Yet to really assert himself in this offense given a mixture of injuries and inexperience, Moss could finally get untracked this week against a Jets team that rates as inviting to opposing backfields. There is real risk in trusting a complementary back for Buffalo in lineups, but at least the matchup is ideal.","Despite delivering just 157 yards and two picks in the air, Newton still compiled a respectable fantasy showing last week thanks to producing his second game of the season with at least 75 rushing yards, joining Kyler Murray and Lamar Jackson as the only quarterbacks with multiple such games this season. With a real lack of production past 10 yards in the passing phase, facing a 49ers defense allowing the ninth-lowest passer rating this season reveals some risk for Newton.","The Chargers have dealt with major injuries on defense already but at least get back edge menace Melvin Ingram after the bye. The Jaguars offer some matchup appeal, but until this D/ST really flashes a penchant for splash plays, it's merely another streaming group.",null,"Fournette was unable to take the field for Week 6 as a lingering ankle injury kept him on the sidelines. He is questionable heading into this week's tilt with the Raiders. With Ronald Jones earning primary-back duties, even if Fournette can indeed don the pads, he'll likely be relegated to a secondary role.

The Eagles hope their Week 9 bye afforded him ample time to heal so he can return for their Week 10 clash with the Giants. If he's healthy, Sanders has a great matchup against a defense allowing the eighth most fantasy points per game to running backs.","After missing Week 8 following surgery on his left index finger, Godwin was able to suit up for the Week 9 Sunday night showcase, catching three balls for 41 yards in the Buccaneers embarrassing loss to the Saints. Even though Antonio Brown is likely to affect his target share, Godwin maintains WR2 status in this week's NFC South battle with a more susceptible Panthers defense.",null,null,"Allen delivered yet another strong statistical showing last week, working with sensational rookie passer Justin Herbert. Allen now has three-straight games with at least nine catches and is averaging nearly 13 targets per game working with Herbert this year. Among the safest and most projectable skill players in fantasy this season, Allen next faces a Dolphins secondary allowing nearly 40 fantasy points per game to receiving corps.","Game flow conspired against Jones in the Buccaneers 38-3 defeat to the Saints in the Week 9 Sunday night spectacle. Jones was already sharing carries with Leonard Fournette, but with Tampa Bay playing from behind the whole evening, Jones rushed just three times. Reduced workload relegates Jones to flex status in Week 10, despite facing a Panthers defense allowing the fourth most fantasy points per game to backs.","Riding a six-game touchdown streak, the longest streak of receiving scores in Texans history and the longest active streak in the NFL, Fuller continues to enjoy a career season for Houston. With at least five targets in six straight games and now a choice matchup with a Browns secondary allowing the fifth-most fantasy points per game to receivers, Fuller enters the week as a high-end WR2.","If he's ready to go for this tilt against the Patriots, a defense allowing roughly 4.8 yards per carry to tailbacks this season, Ingram profiles as the same risky, touchdown-needy option he's been for much of the season.","An efficient receiving showing helped offset ugly rushing metrics for Moss in Week 9 in a performance buoyed by his rushing touchdown in the win. It's also worth noting that Moss earned 16 of his 18 rushing yards after contact, a sign of poor run blocking by Buffalo. The Cardinals are up next and have allowed 4.3 yards per carry and roughly 99 rushing yards per game to backfields, with Moss poised as a touchdown-dependent option.","While he still isn't finding success scoring via the air, Newton does impressively have eight rushing scores this season, tied for third most in the entire league. Next up in a battle of dual-threat former MVPs, Newton faces a Ravens defense allowing the 12th-fewest fantasy points to quarterbacks. Given his dependence on rushing success to deliver solid fantasy outcomes, Newton enters this AFC matchup with pronounced risk.","With two-or-fewer fantasy points in four of the past five outings for this group, the Chargers' defense has yet to live up to the considerable depth and talent the group claims. Miami presents some upside for this defense if because they are sending out a quarterback for just his third career start, but the longer sample suggests this group could disappoint.",null,"After falling behind by four touchdowns midway through the second quarter of Week 9's Sunday night affair, Tampa Bay abandoned the run so Fournette only had one carry on the evening.

Even so, with his volume and big-play ability, Sanders should continue along as an RB1.","Antonio Brown's involvement didn't detract from Godwin as he led the Buccaneers with 92 receiving yards on six catches in Tampa Bay's Week 10 throttling of Carolina. Next on the calendar, it's the Rams who travel to Raymond James Stadium for this week's Monday night showcase. Godwin will be challenged by one of the league's stingiest secondaries, so temper expectations to the WR3 level for Week 11.","Ridley last played in Week 8, leaving Atlanta's game with a sprained foot. The Falcons hope missing Week 9, when added to the bye, affords him ample time to heal. Still,  Ridley enters Week 11 as questionable. If deemed healthy, Ridley is a solid WR2 facing a New Orleans secondary ranking mid-pack in fantasy points per game allowed to wide receivers.","Gurley and his teammates enjoyed the Week 10 bye but are now preparing to meet the Saints on the road at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. Gurley will aim to continue his scoring spree as he's hit paydirt in seven of the Falcons' nine games, including each of the last three contests. However, the New Orleans front is tough against the run, surrendering only two rushing scores in nine games, rendering Gurley an RB2.","A touchdown helped save an otherwise inefficient outing for Allen this past Sunday, as he was only able to secure 43% of his targets. The good news is that we can project another strong workload for Allen amid a friendly matchup with a Jets secondary allowing 40.3 fantasy points per game to receivers ","An early fumble usually means Jones hits the pine, but Week 10's miscue didn't sway his usage for a change. In fact, Jones went on to ramble for 192 yards on 23 carries (including a score), adding a six-yard catch to fall just shy of 200 scrimmage yards. Hopefully, Jones' fantasy managers were able to take advantage of his career day, because next up is the Rams -- one of the league's top units in defending the run.

Healthy again, Ridley regains every-week status and even possesses WR1 upside if Jones isn't at 100% when the Falcons entertain the Raiders on Sunday.","Week 11 did not go well for Gurley. He was bottled up early by the Saints and their No. 1 defense against the run, carrying the ball eight times for just 26 yards. After Atlanta fell behind and was forced to throw, Gurley wasn't a factor at all in the Falcons' passing game, catching 1-of-2 targets for just three yards.

The Lions have struggled in coverage on the outside this season, setting up Fuller as a high-ceiling fantasy starter.","It's not clear if Ingram is fully recovered from a recent ankle injury, but whatever the impetus, his role has dramatically dwindled for this Baltimore offense in recent weeks; the veteran bruiser was on the field for just nine snaps and tallied two scrimmage yards on two touches.

Dobbins placed on the reserve list due to positive COVID-19 results, it's unlikely we see either on the field against a tough Pittsburgh defense on Thursday evening.","If it feels like Moss needs to enter the end zone to deliver a helpful fantasy performance, it's probably because it's true; the rookie hasn't topped 10.2 fantasy points this season in a game that he hasn't scored. Working in his favor for this week, however, is a matchup with a Chargers defense allowing the ninth-most fantasy points per game to backs. Moss enters the week as a risky fantasy play.","Newton has won just three of his 18 career games with at least 40 passing attempts, including last week's loss to Houston. The Cardinals haven't been great against opposing signal-callers this season, while Newton's struggles as a passer position him as a low-end streaming option. ","Disclaimer: the Chargers' strong defensive showing this week came against the Jets. This said, it was impressive to see Joey Bosa create seven pressures in a return form injury. Facing a dangerous dual-threat quarterback this week, it's best to consider this D/ST as part of the streaming tier at the position.",null,"After not scoring since Week 2, Fournette found paydirt with a two-yard jaunt in the Monday night spotlight, salvaging an otherwise tepid Week 11 effort. Despite facing a generous Chiefs run defense in Week 12, Fournette's contributions with Tampa Bay have been too sporadic to be considered for a fantasy lineup.",null,"The Cardinals provide sacks and takeaways regularly enough to find themselves in the mix as a D/ST option each week. Against the low-upside New England offense, that's certainly the case in Week 12. Consider this unit to be a low-end starting option. "],"13":["Week 12's Monday night date with the Seahawks appeared to be a great spot for Sanders, but even with the game being close most of the way, he was barely involved in the Eagles offense. Sanders saw only eight touches for a season-low 22 scrimmage yards. Week 13 is just as favorable with a trip to Lambeau Field on the docket. Look for Sanders to return to RB1 production against a vulnerable Packers defense.",null,"Just as he did in the Falcons' first two games this season without Julio Jones, Ridley stepped up in Week 12, leading all Atlanta receivers with six catches for 50 yards and a score. Next up is a home matchup with NFC South rival New Orleans and the defense yielding the 11th-fewest WR fantasy points per game. Ridley remains a must start, but temper your expectations.","In Week 12, Gurley missed his first game of the season as he was unable to suit up for the Falcons' resounding win over the Raiders. Details weren't disclosed, but it was reportedly related to his arthritic knees. His Week 13 availability is unclear. If he's able to go, Gurley is very TD-dependent and the Saints allow the fewest rushing scores per game in the league, lowering fantasy expectations to the flex range.","Despite throwing a touchdown to Allen this past Sunday, Justin Herbert had a hard time getting the ball to him throughout the loss to Buffalo, completing just four of his 10 attempts to the Pro Bowl wideout, the lowest catch percentage for Allen with Herbert as his starting QB. Entering this week, Herbert and Allen had connected on 77 receptions, the most in the league by a duo this season. Given the larger sample of success, even facing a solid set of New England corners isn't enough to slow down this impressive passing battery.",null,"A massive Thanksgiving performance appears to be Fuller's last performance of the 2020 campaign, as the speedster is reportedly suspended for the remainder of the season. ","Sidelined by a positive COVID-19 test for Week 12's tilt with the rival Steelers, Ingram isn't likely to help fantasy managers if activated in time for this upcoming matchup with the Cowboys given he's only topped six fantasy points twice on the entire season.","Moss was outperformed by peer Devin Singletary in every respect this past Sunday, adding risk to an already sketchy statistical outlook for this rookie. If he's not consuming the majority of early-down opportunities, then it's truly difficult to project Moss for a worthy fantasy outcome against a solid San Francisco front.","The Patriots are finding ways to win despite posting one of the league's least productive passing games; Newton delivered his second game-winning drive of the season in downing the Cardinals this past Sunday, but also became the fourth starting signal-callers in the past 10 seasons with fewer than 100 passing yards, zero touchdowns and two picks in a victory. Struggling to move the ball downfield and particularly unproductive when pressured, Newton will likely need to tally a strong day on the ground to help fantasy rosters against a respectable Chargers defense.","Three turnovers and three sacks helped overcome coughing up 27 points for the eighth straight week. This defense was supposed to be nearly elite, but hasn't lived up to the hype. The Patriots' offense is quite weak, however, thus Joey Bosa and crew could help this D/ST produce a solid outing if based on matchup alone.",null,null,null,"The Cardinals defense and Rams offense are trending in opposite directions. That's a good thing if you were thinking about using Arizona's D/ST as a solid fantasy option in Week 13. Los Angeles gave away the ball four times in Week 12 against San Francisco, while the Cardinals forced a pair of turnovers against New England in their last outing. Give the Cardinals some consideration when looking for your D/ST this week."],"14":["In Week 13,  Sanders registered his second straight subpar effort, mustering only 31 yards on 10 carries (and no catches) as the Packers defense kept him bottled up in the Eagles' loss. A rebound will be challenging as on deck is a Week 14 visit from the stout Saints defense. Normally an automatic starter, Sanders' recent struggles and the Eagles' sputtering offense drops him down to the flex against New Orleans.","Early in the week, Godwin had surgery to remove the pins from his fractured left index finger but its unclear if he'll be able to suit up this week. Tampa Bay comes out of their Week 13 bye with a home date against Minnesota. If Godwin plays, he's a solid Week 14 start against a Vikings secondary allowing the fifth-most WR fantasy points per game.","In Week 13, Ridley eclipsed the century mark in receiving yards for the fifth time this season, but the first occasion since Week 5. He hauled in 5-of-10 targets for 108 yards in Atlanta's loss to the Saints. Ridley's floor makes him a must-start, as he has had seven-plus targets in all but two of the games in which he's played. However, Week 14 is a tough matchup against a Chargers secondary yielding the fewest receptions and fifth-fewest yards per game to wideouts.","After having missed the previous game due to a knee injury, Gurley returned in Week 13. However, he split backfield duties with Ito Smith and only managed 16 yards on eight carries, along with one catch for four yards. Assuming no setbacks, Gurley's workload is expected to return to where it was before his arthritic knee acted up. Week 14 presents a great chance to be productive facing a Chargers defense surrendering the 11th-most RB fantasy points per game.","An ugly outing overall for the Chargers' offense left Allen with a modest line despite pacing the team with 11 targets. A sluggish catch rate against a Patriots defense that playing at a high level this past week is likely just a matchup-driven outcome, as Allen next faces a porous Atlanta pass defense. Given such an awesome share of the Chargers' passing game, Allen makes for a strong play this week.","Jones' Week 12 featured a pair of big plays, which rescued what appeared to be a second straight subpar effort. He reeled off a 30-yard run, but the capper was a 37-yard scoring strike -- the first TD catch of his career. Jones remains in a timeshare in the Tampa Bay backfield, but with a Week 14 date against a beatable Vikings defense, he's in play as an RB2.",null,"Afforded just seven touches and three routes in the win over Dallas this past Tuesday, Ingram appears to have lost all fantasy value in a committee backfield for Baltimore. The Browns have allowed the ninth-fewest fantasy points to backfields on the season, confirming Ingram's spot on the bench or free agency in all formats.","An early fumble saw Moss lose out on work for the rest of the game, as Devin Singletary paced the backfield by a wide margin in touches and scrimmage yardage. It's unclear if this mistake will cost him this coming week against Pittsburgh, but recent trends suggest this is becoming Singletary's backfield.","Newton helped orchestrate the team's fourth-largest margin of victory in franchise history this past week by producing his 10th career game with at least two rushing scores and a passing touchdown, extending his own NFL record. With four games with multiple rushing scores this season, Newton is just one such performance shy of tying Corey Dillonâ€™s franchise record. The Patriots next face a much bigger challenge in the Rams, lowering Newton's fantasy value a significant degree this week.","Getting routed by 45 points is likely a bad thing for fantasy production, especially as the Chargers' special teams produced one of the worst performances on record. Defensive opponents of the Falcons -- this week's opponent -- have averaged just 3.7 fantasy points, evidence there's a lot of risk with the Chargers this week.",null,"Fournette's portion of the Buccaneers' backfield share continued a downward trend in Week 12 as he mustered just six touches, his lowest total since joining the Tampa Bay RB rotation. Perhaps the Week 13 bye will refresh the 25-year-old running back, but it's too risky to trust Fournette in any Week 14 fantasy lineups.",null,"The Giants were able to lean on the running game in Week 13 and Colt McCoy piloted the offense to a fairly clean win. That's bad news for the Cardinals D/ST, which needs a good matchup to be an appealing fantasy option. Look elsewhere for Week 14."],"15":["Buoyed by an 82-yard TD jaunt, Sanders broke out of a two-game malaise, helping the Eagles down the Saints in the biggest upset of Week 14. Sanders rushed 14 times for 115 yards, while also adding a second touchdown. The pair of scores were his first since Week 5. Consider Sanders to be an RB2 when the Eagles fly to Arizona for Week 15's date with the Cardinals.","Godwin had the pins removed from his surgically-repaired finger early last week but he was still able to suit up for the Buccaneers' Week 14 triumph over Minnesota. His production was low with just two catches for 25 yards, but that was more a result of Tom Brady completing only 15 passes, rather than anything to do with the injury. Godwin's activity should increase to WR3 level in Week 15 when Tampa Bay visits Atlanta and one of the most-generous secondaries in the NFL.","Ridley stepped up in Julio Jones' absence, reeling in eight balls for 124 yards, including a 39-yard scoring dart from wildcat QB Russell Gage, but it wasn't enough as the Falcons fell to the Chargers in Week 14. Ridley has proven productive both with and without Jones in the lineup, so he continues to be an automatic start in Week 15 when the Falcons entertain the Buccaneers for the first time this season.","Gurley's second-half swoon continued as he carried the ball a season-low six times for just 19 yards while catching two balls for an additional dozen. The TD-reliant back hasn't scored since Week 9. With his limited involvement in the Falcons' passing game and recent lack of touches, Gurley is no better than a Week 15 flex option when Tampa Bay visits Mercedes-Benz Stadium.","Having just posted his sixth game of the year with at least 20 fantasy points in ESPN PPR formats, Allen has been among the most consistent fantasy forces at his position this year. A hamstring injury seemed to have limited his snap count against the Falcons, so it's worth following this injury throughout the week, but Allen is in a great spot to produce if active this week against a suspect pass defense.","With Leonard Fournette sitting out Week 14 as a healthy scratch, Jones carried the ball 18 times, his most work since Week 10. Jones ended up with 80 yards and a score but also fractured a pinky, requiring surgery similar to what teammate Chris Godwin endured earlier this season. It's unclear if he'll suit up in Week 15 but, if so, Jones will be challenged by a Falcons defense that has held opposing runners to the seventh-fewest fantasy points in the league. Should he be active, Jones is a flex play, based on volume and involvement in the passing game.",null,"Given just a single snap and zero touches this past week in a rushing party in prime time, it's clear that Ingram simply can't help fantasy rosters for this matchup with the Jaguars.","Recovering from a short-term demotion last week due to fumbling issues, Moss led the team with 13 touches this past Sunday evening, albeit with another quiet fantasy line as a result. The Broncos are up next and haven't been very tough against the run, but Moss would need to score in order to pay off as a fantasy starter, thus there is pronounced risk present.","The Patriots only scored three points on four red zone trips this past week. Newton couldn't get anything going against the Rams this past week in his worst outing of the season. The Dolphins couldn't contain Newton on the ground back in Week 1, but you'd be gambling on him repeating such success as a rusher in order to help fantasy teams this week.","With two-or-fewer sacks in six of the past seven games, this Chargers' D/ST hasn't had a very high ceiling given the lack of pressure on the pocket. The Raiders have struggled to protect the ball lately, but also scored 31 on the Chargers a few weeks back, signaling a low floor for this group.",null,null,null,"The Cardinals racked up more sacks against the Giants than they had managed in their previous four games combined. So, while a D/ST coming off of such a successful effort might be tempting to add to your fantasy lineup, this isn't a \"slam dunk\" selection. After all, this unit has finished with four-or-fewer fantasy points eight times this season. However, against a rookie quarterback, the Cardinals do offer decent upside in Week 15."],"16":["In Week 15, Sanders toted the ball 17 times, his highest total since Week 2. Still, he mustered only 64 yards, though he did add 26 more on his sole reception as the Eagles fell to Arizona. With defenses having to account for Jalen Hurts' dual passing/rushing abilities, Sanders is in a good spot to finish the season strong, especially in Week 16 against a suspect Cowboys unit. Look for Sanders to return to RB1-level production.","Godwin secured 4-of-5 targets for 36 yards, including a four-yard scoring strike in the Buccaneers' victory over the Falcons in Week 15. Tom Brady likes to spread the ball around, but with Week 16's foe being a vulnerable Lions defense, Godwin's involvement warrants a WR3 ranking for the Saturday affair.","Ridley was one of Week 15's standout performers as he hauled in 10 balls for 163 yards and a score. It was the third consecutive game (and seventh overall) in which Ridley has surpassed the century mark, elevating him to WR1 status for the season. Week 16 should offer more of the same when Atlanta travels to Arrowhead Stadium for an encounter with the AFC-leading Chiefs.","Gurley has been officially demoted to No. 2 on the Falcons' RB depth chart, behind Ito Smith. The former fantasy stalwart played on only 16 snaps (a season-low) in Atlanta's Week 15 loss to Tampa Bay. With roster spots so valuable, it's safe to drop Gurley in advance of the Falcons' Week 16 road date with the Chiefs.","A hamstring limited Allen to just 12 routes and three targets in a disappointing outing for the proven veteran wideout. The target magnet would need to be a better spot health-wise to produce a strong line in Week 16, but it does help his case as a fantasy starter that he produced nine catches and a touchdown against the Broncos earlier this year.","Jones missed his first game of the 2020 season in Week 15 as he had early-week surgery on a fractured finger and then was placed on the league's reserve/COVID-19 list. If he's able to don the pads in Week 16, Jones has a favorable matchup with Tampa Bay heading to Detroit, where the league's most generous run defense awaits. Even better, the contest is on Saturday, so you'll know one day early whether or not you'll need someone else to fill his spot.",null,"A healthy scratch this past weekend, it's clearly time to let Ingram hit free agency in fantasy formats.","Pacing the Bills' backfield in touches this past week, Moss is still in a somewhat limiting committee for Buffalo. Given that he and Devin Singletary share work nearly evenly most weeks, it's tough to deploy Moss in the fantasy playoffs. It helps in one sense that the Patriots have allowed the 12th-most fantasy points to backs, yet the aforementioned risk still looms.","Now with 17 straight starts with one-or-fewer passing touchdowns, Newton dubiously now claims the longest such streak ever by a former NFL MVP. That said, you aren't rostering Newton for his passing prowess at this point and instead rely on his still-special rushing production. The Bills present enough of a challenge defensively to push Newton into the QB2 tier.","With zero fantasy points against the Raiders and just four sacks across the past four games, the Chargers' defense has been quiet of late. Back in Week 8, this group delivered just two fantasy points and two sacks against the Broncos, confirming this D/ST as a mediocre option heading into Week 16.",null,null,null,"The Cardinals have been on the rise as a D/ST in recent weeks and, after sacking Jalen Hurts six times, they now have 14 sacks over the past two games. Next up is a matchup with the 49ers -- a very low-upside offense -- keeping Arizona in the mix as a decent low-end starting option at D/ST."],"17":["Sanders scored his sixth rushing touchdown in Week 16, capping a day where he carried the ball 15 times for 57 yards to go along with four receptions for another 27 yards. The Eagles were eliminated from playoff contention with their loss to the Cowboys, but can play spoiler in Week 17 when Washington looks to take down the NFC East with a win. Sanders will be facing one of the league's top run defenses, but his volume merits another fantasy start.","After seeing only eight combined targets in Weeks 14-15, Godwin was targeted nine times in Week 16, securing five catches for 84 yards and a score. The Buccaneers are playing to win Week 17's meeting with Atlanta, fantasy's third-most generous secondary. As such, Godwin remains a safe play as Tampa Bay looks to lock down a better playoff seed.","Ridley continued his elevated play in Week 16, surpassing the century mark in receiving yards for the fourth straight game and the eighth time this season. Ridley caught five balls for 130 yards. He's in line for another big week as the Falcons travel to Tampa Bay in their season finale to face the 12th-most generous secondary with respect to WR fantasy points per game.","In a bit of a role reversal, Gurley led all Falcons running backs with three targets in Week 16. He caught them all for 34 yards, along with gaining 16 additional yards on four carries. That said, there's no reason to expect Gurley to return to fantasy prominence when the Falcons close out the season in Tampa Bay.","A week removed from trying to hit the field despite a lingering hamstring injury, Allen didn't play this past Sunday against the Falcons. If Allen is closer to full capacity this week, then he could help fantasy investors given his awesome blend of route running and target volume against what should be the Chiefs' backups.","Following surgery on a broken finger, Jones missed his second straight game in Week 16. The Buccaneers are hopeful that Jones can return in Week 17 against a vulnerable Atlanta defense. Jones may not be in line for his pre-injury workload, but the club would like to get him ready for the playoffs. As such, he should still see fantasy-worthy action, even if only in RB2 territory.",null,null,"Earning 13 touches to Devin Singletary's dozen this past Monday evening and delivering just five more yards from scrimmage, the key differentiator in the contest was Moss producing a touchdown. The Dolphins have ceded the 10th-fewest fantasy points to backs this season, curbing any enthusiasm for this rookie rusher.","Newton's stretch of one-or-fewer touchdowns passes in 14 starts tied him for the longest such streak since 1950. Pulled this past week in a blowout loss to the Bills that saw him deliver the fewest passing yards in a game in his career, Newton's status this week is a bit uncertain, although you likely shouldn't trust whoever the team deploys behind center this week.","With just six sacks over the past four games, this D/ST has proven reliant on point allowance to drive helpful fantasy outcomes. The good news this week is that the Chiefs are set to sit key starters this week, setting up Los Angeles as a solid streaming candidate.",null,null,null,"Both teams will have everything to play for in Week 17, and the Cardinals will be looking for revenge after dropping the previous matchup between the two clubs.

Consider them as a flier option for the 2020 finale."],"8":[null,"Godwin will miss Week 8 after requiring surgery on his fractured left index finger.","Ridley's volume has been down over the past two weeks, coinciding with the return of Julio Jones. He's was, however, on the business end of a scoring strike in both those games. In Week 7, he secured 5-of-7 targets for 69 yards and the score. On paper, Thursday night's date with the Panthers is a tough matchup, but Tom Brady just victimized Carolina for 287 yards and three touchdowns, so don't downgrade Ridley too much. He's still a low-end WR1.","Why isn't the Falcons defense being held accountable after Gurley's \"inadvertent touchdown\" in Week 7? His fantasy managers didn't complain as the late score was his second touchdown of the day, capping a productive afternoon. Gurley lines up for another solid effort as the Falcons visit the Panthers on Thursday night. Carolina has yielded the second-most RB fantasy points per game, including a league-high nine rushing touchdowns in seven contests.","It's been quite the boon for Allen's production pattern that Justin Herbert has been the quarterback for much of the season. The vertical work is rewarding and the sheer volume of Allen's target share fuels a really reliable fantasy prospect. The Broncos have allowed nearly 38 fantasy points per game to receiving corps, leaving room for Allen to meet and even surpass his robust projection.","Despite eclipsing the century mark on the ground in each of the prior three weeks, Week 7 saw Jones share the RB workload with the returning Leonard Fournette. Jones amassed just 34 rushing yards on 13 carries along with one catch for two yards, though he did score on a one-yard plunge. Despite a great matchup against the soft Giants run defense on tap, Jones' reduced involvement in Tampa Bay's offense drops him to an RB2.",null,"Diagnosed with a high-ankle sprain suffered in the team's win against the Eagles back in Week 6, Ingram's availability isn't clear just yet for this pivotal matchup with the Steelers. If he's able to go against a Pittsburgh defense allowing just 58.5 rushing yards per game to backfields, second fewest in the league, Ingram doesn't present much fantasy value given this poor matchup and a dwindling share of a three-headed committee.","Churning out 72 scrimmage yards on 10 touches against the Jets this past week, Moss finally looked fully healthy on the field for Buffalo. Given he's not the lead option in the backfield with Devin Singletary in place, Moss isn't yet a worthy fantasy starter, even as the Patriots' defense has struggled against the run.","It was a day of highs and lows in Week 7 saw Newton reach 30,000 career passing yards, becoming the first player in NFL history with at least 30,000 passing yards and at least 5,000 rushing yards. Then again, he was pulled in the loss due to poor play and eroding success in the passing phase for this offense. Back at the helm this week for a meeting with the Bills' solid defense, Newton isn't a strong starting option.","An average pressure rate holds back this D/ST from really producing some fantasy. A nice matchup with a Denver offense struggling with turnovers and sacks awaits, supporting some streaming value for this defense.

He did not return to the game and enters this week as questionable for Sunday's home tilt with Denver. If he suits up, Ridley remains a low end WR1, but monitor the injury news throughout the week.","In last Thursday's victory over the Panthers, Gurley salvaged a rather quiet night with a fourth quarter touchdown. He had 18 rushes for 46 yards including the score but didn't register a target all evening. Next on the docket is a Broncos defense holding opposing running backs to the seventh-fewest fantasy points per game, landing Gurley as a high-end RB2 this week.","Enjoying one of the better workloads in the league and thriving with a daring rookie passer, Allen enters this week's matchup of division rivals with real momentum. The Raiders have been respectable against receivers this season and soft against the run, but Allen's huge share of this offense spells WR1 value for Week 9.","Losing a first-half fumble didn't help matters, but it's apparent that Jones was destined for a secondary role behind Leonard Fournette in Monday night's narrow 25-23 win over the New York Giants. Jones carried the rock just seven times for 23 yards, though he did secure all four of his targets for another 23 yards. With a reduced workload and the tough New Orleans run defense in the house on Sunday night, Jones falls to the flex level for Week 9.","Fresh off the bye riding a five-game streak with at least one receiving score, Fuller's stretch of touchdown success ties him with DeAndre Hopkins for the longest such streak in Texans history. A key vertical playmaker for Houston, Fuller is poised to excel facing a Jacksonville secondary allowing 13.4 yards per catch to receivers on the season.","Some reports suggest Ingram could miss this week's matchup with the Colts due to an ankle injury, but the week of practice will reveal more information. If he's active and able, Ingram is likely only going to handle around a dozen early-down touches against a stingy Colts defense allowing only 3.26 yards per carry and the second-fewest yards per game (63.3) to opposing backfields. A limited workload in a crowded committee in one of the toughest matchups means Ingram is a really risky flex option.","Moss became the first Bills skill player with multiple rushing scores since LeSean McCoy back in the middle of the 2018 season. The box score reveals a nearly even split for work with Devin Singletary, save for Moss' two rushing scores, both of which came on goal-line touches. With the potential to lead the backfield in snaps for yet another week against a solid Seattle rush defense, Moss makes for a helpful option in deeper leagues and those with multiple flex spots. ","Another week with a rushing score for Newton is impressive on one hand, but the utter lack of scoring output as a passer is troubling, as he hasn't thrown for a score since Week 3. The good news is that the Jets are up next, setting up Newton as a streaming option with an eye on finally lighting up the board in the passing department.","This D/ST has produced a series of weak showings this season and simply hasn't shown up in the splash play or pass rush departments.

took a while for him to get rolling, but Sanders certainly took command of lead-back duties in Philadelphia during the second half of his rookie season. Sanders put down a solid 179-818-3 rushing line, but where he truly stood out was as a receiver. Sanders' 50-509-3 line was fueled by 8.2 yards per target, which was second best at the position. Sanders didn't play more than 53% of the snaps in a game until Week 11, but he finished 15th among backs in fantasy points. The 23-year-old is primed for a larger share of the workload behind the Eagles' elite offensive line in 2020. Consider him a strong RB2 with upside for more.","Godwin is entering his fourth NFL season and his second as a full-time player. His first season as a full-timer went, in a word, well. Inexplicably a situational player under Dirk Koetter, Godwin finished 2019 ranked as a top-10 WR in snaps, routes, yardage and touchdowns. He finished fourth at the position in catch rate (72%) and RAC (6.6) and was first in first-down rate (50%). Godwin is a candidate for touchdown regression (9 TD, 5.1 OTD) in 2020 and will have a new quarterback in Tom Brady, but the 24-year-old appears to be the real deal. Consider him as a solid WR1.","Ridley enters his third NFL season as Atlanta's No. 2 wide receiver behind Julio Jones. The 2018 first-round pick impressed during his first two campaigns, catching 69% of his passes and averaging a healthy 8.0 YPT. Ridley took a step forward last season and actually had one of the highest floors in fantasy, finishing 27th or better during nine of his 13 outings. He sat 14th at the position in fantasy points prior to Week 14's season-ending abdomen injury. Especially with Mohamed Sanu and Austin Hooper gone, Ridley's role as Matt Ryan's No. 2 target is safe. The 25-year-old is a fringe top-20 fantasy receiver.","Gurley is now the lead back in Atlanta following five seasons with the Rams. The Georgia product was a top-three fantasy RB in both 2017 and 2018, but he handled a lesser workload and struggled badly with efficiency in 2019 while dealing with knee and ankle concerns. After averaging 4.89 YPC (2.11 YAC) on 256 carries and 7.4 yards per target on 78 targets in 14 games in 2018, Gurley's numbers plummeted to 3.84 YPC (1.81 YAC) on 223 carries and 4.2 YPT on 49 targets in 15 games last season. Gurley still managed a 14th-place finish in fantasy points (his fifth top-15 in as many tries), thanks to 14 touchdowns. Gurley's durability is a big concern, but he has little competition for touches in a good offense. He's a fine RB2 target.","Allen enters his eighth NFL season in unfamiliar territory. The 2013 third-round pick has been targeted 758 times in his career -- and 751 of them have come from the hand of Philip Rivers. Rivers, who is now with the Colts, has helped Allen to top-13 finishes in targets, receptions, receiving yards and fantasy points in each of the past three seasons. Even with Rivers, Allen is coming off a very boom/bust fantasy campaign in which he was a top-20 WR in half of his outings, but outside the top 30 during the other half. Allen is still in his prime at age 28 and hasn't missed a game since 2016, but he hasn't scored more than six TDs in any season since 2013. The uncertainty of the Chargers' quarterback situation is a red flag, so Allen is best viewed as a WR2.","Following what was a disastrous rookie season in 2018, Jones added weight and got his career back on track with an impressive showing in 2019. After totaling 77 yards on 30 touches in 2018, Jones produced 1,003 yards and six touchdowns on 203 touches last season. Despite his second-round pedigree and superior play relative to his counterparts in the Tampa Bay backfield, Jones was limited to only 37% of the snaps and 47% of the designed runs. It's very possible we've yet to see the best of Jones, as he was drafted very young and is entering his age-23 season. However, following the offseason additions of Leonard Fournette, LeSean McCoy and Ke'Shawn Vaughn, Jones is not an appealing flex options. He should be on benches unless he earns clear lead duties.","The Texans traded away DeAndre Hopkins during the offseason, which should vault 2016 first-round pick Fuller to a full-on fantasy breakout. The problem, of course, is that Fuller is entering his fifth NFL season having already missed 34% of his team's games because of injury. That number includes five games last season. The good news is that, when healthy, Fuller has been heavily targeted and productive. In nine full games last season, he handled 7.7 targets per game (a 25% share) and trailed Hopkins by only nine total targets. He was fantasy's No. 13 WR in those weeks. It's hard to expect a full season from the oft-injured receiver, but Fuller undoubtedly still has massive upside. The 26-year-old is best viewed as a flex.","Volume is king in fantasy football, but Ingram did his best to be the exception to that rule during his first season as Baltimore's lead back. Despite handling only 37% of the team's carries and 7% of the targets, Ingram was fantasy's No. 11 scoring RB, thanks to the Ravens' high-scoring offense. Ingram ranked 22nd in touches and 15th in scrimmage yards, but his 15 touchdowns ranked fourth. An injury-plagued 2018 season aside, Ingram has been a top-15 fantasy RB each season since 2014. Despite the positivity, it will be hard to count on a repeat from Ingram in 2020. He's now 30, which means his volume is unlikely to rise (especially with J.K. Dobbins now in the mix), he plays a minimal role as a receiver and the Baltimore offense figures to regress in scoring. Ingram is a fringe RB2 with a low ceiling.","The Bills selected Moss with a third-round pick in April's draft. Moss is an elite prospect in two key areas: YAC (second-best in this year's rookie class in 2019) and forced missed tackles (second). The Utah product has terrific size (5-foot-9, 223 pounds) and the balance, toughness, quickness and receiving ability to emerge as one of the game's top backs, though speed is a major concern following his 4.65 40-yard dash at the combine. Moss joins Devin Singletary in the Bills' backfield. The two figure to limit each other's fantasy output, though the rookie has 20 pounds on his new teammate, which could vault him into a significant role on early downs and at the goal line. Moss could flirt with the flex radar and is a fine mid-round target.","Newton signed with the Patriots following nine seasons in Carolina. The dual-threat quarterback was playing some of the best ball of his career in 2018, but that campaign was cut short by a late-season shoulder injury and a foot injury derailed his 2019 campaign. Newton attempted only 89 passes and ran the ball five times in two games prior to being shut down for the season. Now that he's 31 years old, it's fair to wonder whether he can still be a factor with his legs and, if not, can he make up for it with his arm? Even missing two games in 2018, Newton finished  top five at the position in carries, rushing yards and rushing touchdowns for the eighth consecutive season, so it's very possible he has something left in the tank. He's worth a late-round flier, as he'll be back on the QB1 radar if he beats out Jarrett Stidham.","The Chargers fell well short of lofty expectations in 2019, and that also applies to the team's D/ST. The unit fell to 21st in fantasy points following three consecutive top-12 campaigns. Los Angeles still showed well in terms of yards (sixth) and points (12th) allowed, but forced a league-low 14 turnovers and managed only 30 sacks (28th). Thomas Davis and Adrian Phillips were the team's only significant offseason losses, with the overall defense upgraded following the addition of Linval Joseph, Chris Harris Jr. and first-round-pick Kenneth Murray to a group that also includes Joey Bosa, Melvin Ingram, Derwin James, Casey Hayward and Desmond King (who has returned one punt for a touchdown each of the past two seasons). This is a fringe starting D/ST.","Howard had the look of a lock for a breakout 2019 season, but Bruce Arians' tight end-unfriendly offense limited the 2017 first-round pick to a 34-459-1 receiving line in 14 games. Howard has now finished top-three in aDOT and top-four in YPR during each of his three NFL seasons, but 10 missed games due to injury have limited his fantasy output. Perhaps Tom Brady can lead Howard to a fourth-year explosion, but it's an extreme longshot with Rob Gronkowski now atop the depth chart (not to mention Cameron Brate also in the mix). Expect Howard to work as a part-time player and blocking specialist. The 25-year-old should only be on rosters in dynasty leagues.","Fournette signed with Tampa Bay after being cut by the Jaguars. At least from a fantasy perspective, Fournette finally lived up to his first-round pedigree during a breakout 2019 season and emerged as one of the league's rare workhorse running backs. During 15 active weeks, Fournette played 88% of the snaps, handling 87% of the carries and 19% of the targets. Fournette finished no lower than seventh among backs in carries, targets, receptions, touches, yards and fantasy points. Fournette's season would've been even more impressive had it not been for some atrocious touchdown luck. Despite a healthy 9.3 OTD (10th highest), Fournette scored three touchdowns. He may lead Tampa Bay in touches this season, but he won't be a workhorse with Ronald Jones and LeSean McCoy (among others) in the mix. Consider him a borderline flex

The Bengals are a friendly first matchup for Ekeler to exploit, as Cincinnati yielded a generous 28 fantasy points per game to backs in PPR formats in 2019.","Second among backs in scrimmage yardage last season, Chubb seems to have lost some luster as a fantasy prospect with the presence of third-down threat Kareem Hunt in the backfield mix. Even if he's isolated to early downs, Chubb remains a must-start option facing a Ravens defense that allowed him to rumble for 183 total yards in a September matchup last season.","A breakout second professional season signals Sutton can handle the responsibility of being Denver's top target in the passing phase. There is arguably more competition for meaningful targets after an offseason loading up on skill players in Denver, but it's still quite clear that Sutton will command a strong share of opportunities. The Titans allowed the 12th-most yards to receivers last season, aiding Sutton's case as a solid fantasy starter.","Higbee finished the season strong in 2019, going for 100-plus yards in four of his final five contests and seeing his target total skyrocket over that span. However, that was with Gerald Everett on the sideline -- a complicating factor that will make the early stages of the 2020 season important in terms of figuring out the fantasy value of both Rams tight ends. By all accounts, Higbee should be one of the team's top passing-game options and a starting fantasy tight end, but keep a careful eye on his usage and playing time in the early games. With all that in mind, the Cowboys were one of the worst teams against tight ends in 2019, making this an excellent spot to roll out Higbee as a fantasy starter.","Ryan has been a regular roller coaster in terms of performance, averaging 25-plus points per game in 2016 and 2018 but only 19 in 2017 and 23 in 2019. Those high marks are still more than good enough for fantasy purposes, but consistency is not among his strengths these days. The Seahawks had a below-average pass defense a year ago, so Atlanta's quarterback should be considered a low-end QB1 for Week 1 of 2020.","A quietly stellar 2019 for Landry saw him establish a new yardage peak thanks to newfound success on vertical opportunities. With 15 hauls for 241 yards against Baltimore in two meetings last season, Landry's success from the slot bodes well for his potential as a flex option in Week 1.","In his NFL debut last season, Hockenson arrived with a flourish, going for 131 yards and a touchdown. However, that was against the Cardinals -- a team notorious for its struggles at defending tight ends -- and he couldn't find that magic again for the rest of the year. He suffered a late-season ankle injury and might not be back to full strength yet, so it's probably wise to take a patient approach with the second-year pro. Leave him out of your Week 1 lineups.","Johnson was very impressive during his first NFL season, averaging over 5.0 YPC in limited work. Things balanced out a bit in Year 2, as that number dropped to 3.6. The reality for 2020 is likely to be somewhere in between, but unfortunately his biggest issue this season might be opportunity. Rookie D'Andre Swift and veteran Adrian Peterson are both poised to cut into Johnson's workload, so he's a risky flex option (at best) against the Bears in Week 1.","Sanders has taken a step back from the high-volume, reliable WR numbers he provided the Broncos in his first three seasons with the team beginning in 2014, but he's also been on some struggling offenses over that time. Linking up with Drew Brees ought to help him get back on track, but to what extent remains to be seen. He could prove to be a solid weekly contributor or we might find that with so many touches going to Michael Thomas and Alvin Kamara, his point totals rise and fall. He should be considered as no more than a flex flier option for Week 1 against a porous Tampa Bay pass defense.",null,"The return of Bradley Chubb to the edge of Denver's defense could prove pivotal to this group's fantasy potential. The Titans yielded the ninth-highest pressure rate in the pocket, aiding this D/ST's potential as a streaming option in Week 1.","The addition of Robby Anderson to the Carolina offense certainly doesn't help Samuel, who has struggled to find a consistent role in this offense since his arrival after the 2017 Draft. He had his best season in 2018, but it wasn't quite good enough (just under 11 points per game) to merit a weekly spot in fantasy lineups. The battle for looks in the Panthers' passing game might not swing in Samuel's favor, so he's a risky flex play for Week 1.","Denver is handing over the offense to this second-year signal-caller. The team invested heavily over the offseason in acquiring receiving and rushing talent to help make Lock's life a bit easier behind center. Relying on a young pocket quarterback in a run-heavy offense to produce strong fantasy numbers against a solid Tennessee defense isn't a great strategy to open the season.","A magical 2018 working with Andrew Luck might just be an outlier in an otherwise mediocre career for Ebron. Then again, the ceiling is fairly high given Ebron is back to working with an established quarterback and should run ahead of Vance McDonald in regards to snaps, routes, and targets. We still don't know just how the split with McDonald will play out, thus it's best to prove patient with Ebron heading into this initial matchup with a Giants defense that was actually solid against tight ends last year.","Big plays in pass defense helped this defense compile 16 picks en route to a top-12 fantasy finish. Relying on such playmaking isn't ideal when it comes to investing in fantasy defenses, thus this first matchup against a talented Houston offense leaves the Chiefs' D/ST as a fringe streaming option."],"2":["The positive spin from Week 1 includes Ekeler earning 20 touches in a victory Austin Ekeler had 50 total snaps at running back â€” that was more than any Chargers back had in any game in 2019. A more concerned lens sees that Ekeler was targeted just once in the game and ceded valuable goal-line work to rookie Joshua Kelley. Ekeler still lined up plenty in the slot and was on the field enough to suggest he'll eventually earn more inclusion in the passing game. A telling test for an uptick in passing opportunities comes this week against a Chiefs front seven that can struggle in coverage.","Sure, game script while trailing big to Baltimore was likely going to favor Kareem Hunt's profile, but it's admittedly disconcerting that Hunt handled more first-down rushes than Chubb en route six more touches. With nearly even usage expected in a more neutral game plan, such as the one expected in Week 2 with the Bengals, Chubb enters the week as an RB2 candidate. ","Inactive with a shoulder injury this past week, Sutton appeared close to suiting up, making his season debut possible this week against the Steelers. If there were an exploitable element in the Steelers' defense it's at outside corner, with Sutton poised as a flex or WR2 option if active.","Higbee was the clear leader in playing time and opportunities among Los Angeles tight ends in Week 1, but Gerald Everett did leave the game with a back injury, so it remains to be seen exactly how these two will work together moving forward. For now, Higbee seems to be the better fantasy option of the two, given his superior role (four targets in Week 1 after finishing last season on a hot streak). He's a borderline starter at a position lacking in great options. ","Ryan led all quarterbacks with 450 yards in Week 1, although most of the damage was done from behind as the Falcons were playing catchup in Seattle for most of the game. Atlanta is on the road again, facing a Dallas defense which allowed 266 passing yards to the Rams in their opener. Ryan should be forced to throw a lot again, rendering him as a top-10 option and a decent QB1 for Week 2.","Last season's solid opportunity rates appear to have carried over, as Landry averaged a healthy 12 air yards per target in Week 1. The Bengals aren't stacked in the secondary, setting up Landry as a solid WR2 or flex candidate for this division matchup.","Another season, another strong Week 1 performance for Hockenson. The second-year pro hauled in all five of his targets -- including his lone look in the red zone -- to finish with 56 yards and a score. He saw extra looks with Kenny Golladay out, but he's also more established and comfortable in the Lions offense as a second-year pro, and could be on the verge of a breakout campaign. He's worth a shot as a low-end starter at his position in Week 2 against Green Bay, especially if Golladay remains out.","Of Detroit's top-three backs, Johnson played on the fewest snaps and saw the least total production in Week 1. That's a worrying sign -- and one that should signal to fantasy managers that Johnson belongs on the bench or waivers for now, at least until the RB depth chart clears up a bit for the Lions.","Though Sanders caught a red-zone touchdown in his New Orleans debut, Drew Brees targeted him just five times, resulting in three receptions for a paltry five yards. Sanders will usually play second fiddle to Michael Thomas, but with his teammate suffering a high-ankle sprain, Sanders' workload could increase against a suspect Las Vegas pass defense. If Thomas is good to go, Sanders is just a flex option. However, if Thomas is out, Sanders leaps up to the WR3 range.",null,"Missing Von Miller and his elite pressure rate, the Broncos struggled to create big plays against the Titans' passing game in Week 1. Now on the road against a capable veteran-led Pittsburgh passing game, Denver isn't a solid option at this matchup-driven position.","On a different team, Samuel could be a productive WR3 or even a WR2, but with DJ Moore and Christian McCaffrey in tow, the 24-year old wideout will likely continue to receive only around the six touches he garnered in Week 1. Samuel is fine as a reserve on deep rosters, but he isnâ€™t someone to count on as a starter.","A modest statistical showing in the opener doesn't offer much hope for Lock to rise to the challenge of playing an elite Pittsburgh defense in Week 2. Missing some key skill players to injury, Lock isn't a worthy option this week.","Preseason talk of Ebron being a dynamic playmaker saw him produce just one catch in his debut with the Steelers. Given the offense essentially ignored the tight end position in the passing phase, Ebron enters this meeting with the Broncos just outside of the starting tier of the position.","The Chargers' new-look offense trends run-heavy overall and conservative in the passing phase. Such an agenda can limit the fantasy fun for an opposing D/ST. One selling point is the Chiefs' elite offense and the value in playing from ahead as a defense. Predicting game script isn't always a solid science, thus Kansas City is more of a fringe play this week."],"3":["Fear of Ekeler losing valuable equity in the receiving phase was countered a bit by Week 2's strong dual-threat showing. It would help Ekeler's weekly floor if he can prove productive as a receiver with Tyrod Taylor this week, but he's back in the RB1 mix either way given the choice matchup and expectedly healthy workload.","A sluggish Week 1 gave way to a brilliant second outing that included pacing the team by 11 touches. Chubb gained 77 yards after contact on 22 rushes in the win over the Bengals and is poised for another strong showing against a capable, but still exploitable, Washington front seven.","A devastating knee injury ends Sutton's season early. ","Higbee had a week-winning fantasy performance against the Eagles, hauling in three touchdowns on five targets to score a ton of points for those who started him. He showed signs of this ability late last season and certainly remains a viable starting option given his playing time in 2020. Just don't expect three scores every week. He's a low-end TE1 against a Bills defense that was solid against tight ends a season ago, but hasn't gotten off to the best start in 2020.","Through two weeks, Ryan is second overall in both passing yards and TD passes, but he checks in as just the No. 6 overall fantasy quarterback since he doesn't run. In Week 3, Ryan faces a tough Bears defense that has only allowed one TD pass so far. Much of Ryan's production has come from behind and the Bears aren't as likely to exploit the Falcons' suspect defense as other teams, so Ryan's attempts and numbers could suffer. This should push him out of his usual QB1 status for Week 3.","Afforded only three targets in Week 2, Landry never really got a shot at producing. Things figure to be better in a softer matchup this week with a Washington secondary that struggles to contain slot weapons.","Hockenson actually leads the Lions in receiving yards through two games, catching all nine of his targets and finding the end zone, as well. The Cardinals have historically been very poor against tight ends and Hockenson appears to be firmly in the Lions' plans on offense, so we recommend him as a low-end starter in most leagues.","Johnson provided the touchdown and the biggest batch of red-zone touches among Detroit's backs in Week 2, but this three-man rotation is not good news for fantasy managers. Johnson, Adrian Peterson and D'Andre Swift are splitting playing time and opportunities, which leaves them all as poor options for Week 3, even against a porous Arizona defense.","For the second straight week, Sanders and Drew Brees failed to click as the wideout hauled in just 1-of-3 targets for 18 yards. Brees tried to get Sanders involved early, but the veteran receiver couldn't handle the pass. Wait for Sanders and Brees to get on the same page before rostering the 33-year-old journeyman receiver.",null,"Tom Brady and the Buccaneers left a few passing scores on the field last week and have actually looked better than the numbers might suggest. Denver, meanwhile, doesn't have a steady pass rush now with Von Miller sidelined, curbing any fantasy fun for this tough matchup against a capable Tampa Bay offense.","Samuel's 51 snaps in Week 2 were only 3 fewer than what Robby Anderson saw -- but that resulted in only six touches. That number could increase significantly with Samuel likely to receive more backfield work due to  Christian McCaffrey being sidelined. Even so, use Week 3 to track Samuel's usage and production. He's not worth investing with a roster spot just yet.",null,"A second week in the system saw Ebron notably earn 30 routes and a healthy 10 air yards per target. While the receiving totals don't show it just yet, there is some potential for a solid showing from Ebron facing a Houston defense allowing nearly a dozen fantasy points per game to tight ends.","An awesome marquee matchup on Monday evening pits Lamar Jackson and the incredible rushing success of the Ravens against the Chiefs' defense. The Chiefs don't rank as a top team in either creating pressure or turnovers, thus it's best to avoid this D/ST in such a challenging matchup."],"4":["An absolute fantasy force in Week 3 thanks to securing all 11 of his targets in addition to delivering a touchdown, the team's shift behind center has worked in Ekeler's favor from a usage standpoint. The Buccaneers have proven stingy against running games, but Ekeler's usage in the passing game keeps him firmly in RB1 territory.","The first Browns player with at least 100 yards on the ground and two rushing scores in consecutive games since Leroy Kelly in 1967, Chubb is proving he can deliver strong fantasy results even amid Kareem Hunt's success. It's not clear if Dallas' rush defense is good or if their pass defense is so permeable that there is a statistical imbalance forming, but Chubb factors as a RB1 candidate either way given his mix of usage and talent.",null,"Higbee is still the clear starter at tight end for the Rams but, after a three-score outing in Week 2, Week 3 brought with it a lackluster performance. Furthermore, the Rams will face a Giants defense that has allowed the seventh-fewest TE fantasy points this season, so a bounce-back Higbee performance seems less likely. He's a low-end starting TE option for this week's game.","Ryan wasn't sharp in Week 3, completing just half of his 38 throws for a season-low 238 yards and one touchdown. A rebound is likely, facing a Packers secondary that has allowed seven scores through the air in what lines up to be a high-scoring Monday night affair. Those disappointed by Ryan's performance last week will likely be happy this week with a potential top-five finish at the QB position.","The Browns didn't have to pass in order to win this past week, thus Landry saw just four targets and shy of 30 total air yards in the win. A more demanding offensive outing against Dallas should see a busier day unfold for Landry. With the Cowboys struggling to contain receivers, things are looking up for Landry.","Hockenson has provided a consistent presence at tight end this season, which is a reassuring sign for the second-year pro. He has at least four receptions and 50 yards in each contest despite changes in the personnel around him in the passing game. Against a New Orleans team that has allowed the most points to opposing tight ends so far this season, he's worth a gamble as a low-end starting option for Week 4.",null,"On the one hand, Sanders is becoming acclimated to the Saints offense, so his role is growing. On the other, his downfield presence isn't consistent with Drew Brees' preference for short passes. Plus, Sanders has to compete with Alvin Kamara and possibly a returning Michael Thomas for targets. Don't roster the recognizable name. The production isn't there.",null,"Losing Jurrell Casey for the year adds to an already devastating series of loses for this defensive roster. The good news is the Jets are the best matchup in fantasy football at the moment in regards to allowing sacks and turnovers without presenting much of a yardage of scoring threat. Given the solid matchup, even Denver's depth issues aren't in the way of fantasy fun.","Samuel had eight touches for 52 yards from scrimmage, both season-highs, as the Panthers took advantage of his versatility with Christian McCaffrey sidelined. Samuel should continue to receive snaps as both a runner and receiver, but not enough to make a fantasy difference against the Cardinals defense in Week 4.",null,"This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","It hasn't been a very productive process facing the Patriots offense, as defenses chase around Cam Newton and the team's deep backfield. The Chiefs have been great in coverage on the outside, but lack the splash plays that fuel fantasy fun."],"5":["A significant hamstring forced Ekeler to be carted off the field in Week 4. Sidelined for several weeks, at a minimum, Ekeler's managers hopefully have Joshua Kelley or another strong insurance plan in place.

Apart from his 3-TD outburst in Week 2, he hasn't delivered fantasy-friendly stats this season. He should be benched in all leagues for now.","Ryan's 285 passing yards in Monday night's affair were helpful, but most fantasy managers were hoping for at least one touchdown. However, the 35-year-old signal caller failed to deliver a scoring strike for the second straight week. Look for Ryan to find the end zone in Week 5, though it won't be easy against a Panthers defense tied for surrendering the eighth-fewest TD receptions in the league. Even so, Ryan is still a low end QB1.","Throwing a long touchdown to a trick play to Odell Beckham Jr. in Week 4 helped make up for modest receiving results for Landry. A nice rapport with Baker Mayfield helps Landry's fantasy profile for this difficult meeting with a solid Colts pass defense. Given his lack of big-play production thus far and this tough matchup, Landry is merely a flex option.",null,null,"Sanders benefited from Drew Brees extending the field more often than usual in Week 4, capturing 6-of-9 targets for 93 yards.

The Raiders, however, don't actually make for a very fun fantasy matchup; Derek Carr's low turnover rate and the team's strong protection metrics up front get in the way."],"12":["Activated from injured reserve and scheduled to resume practice this week, it's difficult to tell if Ekeler will be active this weekend for key AFC matchup with the Bills. If he's good to go, Ekeler provides real value for patient investors","The rare back who can bulldoze even the best of rush defenses, Chubb cruised to another triple-digit day on the ground, which is impressively his 15th such performance of his career and fourth this season. The Jaguars' defense offers much less resistance than Philadelphia's front, setting up this early-down force as a solid flex candidate.",null,"Both Higbee and Gerald Everett caught four passes for pedestrian yardage totals in Week 11 -- another sign that these two tight ends are splitting time and volume and can't be started in fantasy lineups at this point. Especially against a San Francisco defense that's great against the TE position, look elsewhere for your fantasy needs this week.","After looking quite rejuvenated with interim coach Raheem Morris at the helm, Ryan surprisingly turned in a Week 11 dud as the Saints pressured him all day, sacking the veteran eight times. Ryan threw for only 232 yards with no touchdowns and two interceptions. The veteran should be able to rebound to QB1 status with a Week 12 date facing the Raiders and a defense allowing the ninth-highest average QB fantasy points per game.","Without a touchdown on the season and with zero games with more than five catches on the campaign, there hasn't been much fantasy fun for Landry's investors this season. The path to production does get a bit easier this week, as the Jaguars have allowed the eighth-most fantasy points per game to receivers. Given the large sample of poor production this season, Landry is positioned as a weak fantasy play.","Hockenson has emerged as one of the better tight ends in fantasy this season, picking up regular targets (40 over his past six games) and finding the end zone five times in 10 starts. He is dealing with a couple of minor injuries so, provided he's active on Thursday, he'll be a must-start in all formats against a mediocre Houston defense.","Johnson may have logged more playing time than Adrian Peterson in Week 11, but that is likely because of the score of the game and not the quality of his output. The duo will reprise their roles in Week 12 should D'Andre Swift sit out again. Houston has allowed the most rushing yards in the league this season, which would favor Peterson's skill set, but Johnson could see some passing-game looks if the game gets out of hand. Still, he's best left on the bench.","This time around, Sanders rebounded from a quiet Week 10, engulfing 4-of-5 targets for 66 yards -- his highest total since retruning from the reserve/COVID-19 list. In Week 12, Sanders faces one of his former teams as the Saints head to Denver. The Broncos possess a league-average secondary, but Sanders' limited involvement in the New Orleans offense over the last three games doesn't merit fantasy consideration.",null,"The Denver pass rush was dominant this past Sunday against Miami; the Broncos pressured Tua Tagovailoa on 40% of his dropbacks and didn't relent once Ryan Fitzpatrick took over. It was an awesome performance from this defense, but reads like an outlier when the full season is considered. This means there is some risk in trusting Denver against the Saints this week, but it might help their case that New Orleans is sending out an inexperienced quarterback.","On Sunday, Samuel rebounded from a lackluster Week 10 with eight receptions for 70 yards, including P.J. Walker's first career TD pass. Teddy Bridgewater will likely be back under center for the Panther's Week 12 visit to Minnesota. Samuel's uneven production is usually too risky to trust, but facing the Vikings' porous secondary elevates Samuel to WR3 territory.","Asked to hand off the ball as a primary task this past Sunday against a Miami defense that struggled to contain the Denver backfield, Lock delivered his third outing of the season without a touchdown in Week 11. Next up is a tough matchup with a Saints team allowing a meager 8.7 fantasy points per game to quarterbacks during the past four games.","With a trip to the end zone in three of his past four outings and a clear grip on top tight end duties in Pittsburgh's productive passing game, Ebron is looking to build on his strong showing against Baltimore back in Week 8.","A goose egg from this crew in terms of fantasy points this past week signals some risk in using this group against a Tampa Bay offense looking to right the ship. With only three sacks the past three games, it's wise to look for stronger options than Kansas City."],"13":["Not only was Ekeler back in action after missing much of the season to injury, he enjoyed a massive workload with a season-high 25 touches and 16 targets.

The Titans just shut down the Colts' ground game, but Chubb's elite talent and heavy workload can offset such matchup concerns.  ",null,"Higbee shook off an injury designation to lead the Rams in playing time at tight end in Week 12, but he managed only a single reception on the day. It seems like Jared Goff has shifted his attention to receiver Josh Reynolds as the Rams' No. 3 pass-catching option, leaving both Higbee and Gerald Everett \"on the outside, looking in\" from a fantasy perspective.","When you're the quarterback for a team putting up 43 points on the scoreboard in today's NFL, it's very likely that you had a big fantasy game. Not so fast. Ryan may have engineered a Week 12 blowout of the Raiders, but he posted a modest 185 yards through the air, albeit with two scoring strikes. Next up is a tough matchup with divisional foe New Orleans, landing Ryan as merely a fringe streaming option.","Turning in his first 100-yard showing of the season, Landry finally thrived working with Baker Mayfield this season. In the Brownsâ€™ 8 wins this season, Baker Mayfield has completed 74% of his passes targeting Landry. In their three losses, that drops to 55%.  With the Titans soft against the pass, it's a good week to deploy Landry in lineups.","Hockenson has emerged as a top-tier fantasy tight end in recent weeks, handling seven-plus targets in four of his last five outings. He does have a bit of big-play potential which helps bolster his fantasy value even when he's not finding the end zone. Against a Chicago team that's weak against tight ends (and strong against pretty much everything else), he's an easy choice as a starter in all formats.","Johnson lost a fumble while racking up almost 100 total yards on 15 touches in Week 12. It was a decent showing, but not one likely to earn him a bigger role in the Detroit offense once D'Andre Swift returns from injury. That return could be as soon as this week, so Johnson is not a name to consider for your fantasy lineups. In case you needed another reason to look elsewhere, the Chicago defense is much tougher than Houston's.","With the Saints playing mostly ball-control, Sanders was targeted just once in Week 12's blowout win over Denver. While Sanders should be more involved in Week 13 when the Saints march to Atlanta, Taysom Hill isn't likely to throw the ball enough for Sanders to be a fantasy contributor.",null,"Placed in poor field position throughout the game against the Saints, things don't get much easier this week with a trip to face the incomparably elite Kansas City passing attack. Even while this defense claims some playmakers, this isn't a good week to trust this D/ST.",null,"With Lock and the rest of the depth chart of Denver's quarterbacks ruled out this past week due to COVID protocol, the Broncos became just the second team since 2000 to finish with one or zero completions since 2005. With Lock likely back behind center this week, things will get better for this passing offense comparatively, but it's worth noting the Chiefs claim the league's second-highest pressure rate.","Second on the Steelers in targets last week and a key read in Ben Roethlisberger's quick-hitting approach, Ebron has been a solid fantasy option at a shallow position for several weeks now. The Washington defense has allowed nearly 13 fantasy points per game to tight ends, supporting a respectable outcome spectrum for Ebron. ","Facing a Denver offense that struggled badly last week without an established quarterback could prove rewarding for this defense. Even if the Broncos field a more capable option behind center, it's a choice matchup for Kansas City given the large point spread and the potential to prove aggressive in getting to the pocket."],"14":["A blowout loss and a struggling rookie quarterback served to limit Ekeler's production this past week. The good news is facing a Falcons defense that while good against the run, has leaked yardage all season via the air. With a truly high ceiling in PPR formats, Ekeler is a fine RB1 option for Week 14.","Even though most of the offensive fireworks for Cleveland came from the passing game in a rousing win over Tennessee this past Sunday, Chubb was stellar on the ground and produced another 100-yard day from scrimmage while also securing a touchdown. Chubb netted six yards per carry against the Ravens back in the opener, but was limited in regards to total touches. With such efficiency as a playmaker on the ground, Chubb can overcome this challenging matchup.",null,"Against the Cardinals in Week 13, Higbee scored a touchdown for the first time since Week 2. Sadly, the score came with only 24 receiving yards on four catches. The split workload of Higbee and Gerald Everett renders both men impossible to trust in fantasy, as Jared Goff has too many quality options in the short-to-intermediate passing game with Cooper Kupp and Robert Woods also commanding plenty of looks. Keep Higbee on the bench this week against the Patriots.","In Week 13, Ryan threw for 273 yards and a score -- with no interceptions for the first time since Week 7 -- but it wasn't enough as the Falcons fell to the Saints. Next up for Atlanta is a road tilt against a Chargers defense tied with the fifth-most passing touchdowns allowed per game. He's been inconsistent, but the favorable matchup renders Ryan in play for Week 14 as a low-end QB1.","An early red zone score and a busy day as Baker Mayfield's top target saw Landry produce another solid game, as the LSU product has amassed nearly 50 fantasy points in ESPN PPR formats the past two games. The Ravens held Landry in check earlier this season, but with increased attention in the passing game and his quarterback playing better, Landry enters Week 14 as a viable flex.","Hockenson matched a season-high with seven grabs in Week 13, further cementing his status as a must-start tight end every week. He's getting healthy target totals and is a key part of the passing game in Detroit. Keep him locked into your lineup for Week 14 against Green Bay.","Johnson might find himself on the injury report this week while D'Andre Swift works his way back from illness. That's not the right combination of events he needs to crack your fantasy lineup, so look to Swift, if healthy, or Adrian Peterson if you want a Detroit back going up against Green Bay's weak run defense.","Sanders caught an efficient 5-of-6 balls for only 39 yards as the Saints marched over the Falcons in Week 13. Sanders continues to be merely a secondary part of the Saints offense, and not involved enough to be considered for New Orleans' Week 14 road affair with the Eagles.",null,"Facing the Chiefs' elite offense is never a fun proposition, as Denver tallied a single sack and zero turnovers in a quiet showing this past Sunday evening. A visit to Carolina doesn't help this defense's profile much, as the Panthers have allowed the 11th-lowest sack rate in the NFL this year.","Samuel begins the week on the reserve/COVID-19 list, reportedly as a close contact. As such, he can be activated for the Panthers Week 14 home date with Denver with five days of negative tests. Samuel has recorded fantasy-quality efforts in three of his past four games, so if he suits up, he's in the flex mix.","Never a lock to deliver fun fantasy results, Lock wasn't at his best in a loss to the Chiefs this past week. The Panthers have been right around league average in defending quarterbacks this season, while Lock simply isn't trustworthy for fantasy purposes at this critical part of the season.","Ranking second on the team in total targets this past week, Ebron is consuming a really nice target share this season for a tight end. The Bills, meanwhile, have allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to tight ends this season, setting up Ebron for a solid showing.","This D/ST hasn't really produced a strong fantasy outcome for several weeks, including a modest showing this past Sunday against the Broncos. A lack of sack production is a real key in this trend, setting up this group in the streaming tier of defenses for this trip to South Florida to face the Dolphins. "],"15":["In the six full games Ekeler has played, he's produced at least nine receptions in half of them. A meeting with a soft Raiders rush defense is quite inviting even while dealing with a seemingly minor quad injury. Given his amazing receiving potential, Ekeler is a fine RB1 candidate for this division matchup.","Another impressive outing for Chubb saw the dynamic rusher deliver his second career game with two rushing scores against the Ravens, while no other Browns player has ever rushed for two scores once against Baltimore. The Giants are respectable against the run, but Chubb's unique elusiveness and playmaking around the red zone make him a must-start option.",null,"Higbee had only two passes thrown to him in Week 14, and will likely be called upon more and more to block for upstart rookie Cam Akers and the Rams' running game in the coming weeks. His split role with Gerald Everett and limited volume take him out of the mix for a starting spot in Week 15 fantasy lineups.","Ryan punctuated a pedestrian Week 14 performance with a pair of late interceptions as the Falcons came up short in their road loss to the Chargers. The veteran completed 21-of-32 for 224 yards and a score. Ryan will look for retribution in Week 15 against a vulnerable Buccaneers pass defense, rendering him a low-end QB1.","With at least nine targets in each of his past three games, Landry's fantasy floor is much more stable these days. The Giants haven't allowed a ton of production to receivers this season, but Landry's ability to churn out receptions from the slot helps his case as a flex candidate.","Since Kenny Golladay has been sidelined, Hockenson might be the biggest beneficiary on the Detroit offense. He's racked up 35 targets over the past four games and emerged as a consistent option at tight end in fantasy. He faces a leaky Tennessee pass defense in Week 15. That's a solid recipe for plugging him in as your starter in any format.","Johnson did score in Week 14, but it was on one of only three touches -- and not representative of his overall performance. D'Andre Swift is back in action and handling the starting RB job for Detroit, leaving both Johnson and Adrian Peterson as backups unfit for a fantasy lineup.","Sanders caught three passes for 48 yards and a touchdown in Week 14, but it wasn't enough as the Saints fell to the Eagles. Next up is a visit from a Chiefs defense yielding the second-fewest WR fantasy points per game. Sanders remains on the fantasy sidelines in Week 15.",null,"The Bills' passing offense is firing on all cylinders this season, while the Denver pass rush has proven inconsistent of late.

Next on the docket is a visit to Lambeau Field. Samuel's volume and dual-threat involvement renders him as a WR3/flex option in Saturday's Week 15 nightcap.","Awesome passing efficiency saw Lock deliver a career-high four scores and a season-high five completions of at least 25 yards in a rousing win over the Panthers last week. While that was fun, this week's matchup with a Bills defense fresh from a strong performance isn't ideal for fantasy production.","A quiet Week 14 showing could give way to a strong Week 15 outing thanks to the Bengals allowing 15.5 fantasy points per game to tight ends, third most in the league. Given the fickle nature of this position, Ebron merits trust in lineups this week given such a great matchup.","The Chiefs struggle badly against the run but prove elite against the pass, suggesting this could be a challenging matchup against a deep New Orleans backfield. In a game with a lofty point total, there is some risk in trusting this group on the road."],"16":["Unable to get loose for a big play this past week, Ekeler grinded out 79 scoreless scrimmage yards on 17 touches. The Broncos haven't been great against the run this year in allowing roughly 24 fantasy points per game to backfields, setting up Ekeler for strong bounce-back performance deep into the fantasy playoffs.","Having scored in all but three games this season and with six scores across his past six appearances, Chubb is the rare early-down force with a high fantasy floor.

He is still splitting time with Gerald Everett, however, and it's impossible to predict continued success for Higbee. Seattle is stronger against tight ends than receivers in their porous secondary, so you should look elsewhere for your Week 16 tight end.","Ryan threw for 356 yards and three scores, but it still wasn't enough as the Buccaneers came from behind in Week 15 to defeat the Falcons. Week 16 brings a road trip to Kansas City for a date with the Chiefs who are trying to nail down the AFC's best record and a first-round playoff bye. Ryan is in play as a low-end QB1 as the Falcons will be forced to the air in order to keep pace with the Patrick Mahomes-led offense.","Last week marked Landry's fourth straight game with at least eight targets and he's now entered the end zone in three of the past four. As the clear top target in the Cleveland passing offense, Landry is in a good spot to deliver fantasy value facing a Jets defense allowing the seventh-most fantasy points to receivers this season.","Hockenson turned in one of his worst performances of the season in Week 15, losing his first fumble of the season and reeling in only two receptions. He should bounce back over the final two weeks, as he's been a focal point of the Lions offense with Kenny Golladay out, but let Week 15 serve as a reminder that he's not quite among the elite tight ends just yet. Against a Tampa Bay defense among the worst at stopping tight ends, he should remain in your lineup this week.","Johnson did not get any looks in the Detroit offense in Week 16 and is the most impacted by the return to health of starter D'Andre Swift. Against a tough Tampa Bay defense, Johnson can stay on waivers in all fantasy leagues.","With Michael Thomas being ruled out of the Saints' Week 15 contest and subsequently placed on injured reserve, Sanders led New Orleans with 76 receiving yards on four catches.

You should seek out stronger matchups than Denver claims this week.","Samuel remained active in the Panthers' Week 15 gameplan, reeling in 4-of-9 targets for 42 yards while carrying the ball twice for six more. While his versatility provides a weekly floor and the occasional breakout game, Samuel isn't reliable enough to trust for fantasy purposes -- especially not in Week 16 against Washington, one of the top defenses in the league.","If you are seeking out a positive take from last week, it's that Lock turned in a second straight game without an interception after having led the NFL in picks from Weeks 6 through 13. Then again, he did cough up a fumble that turned into a touchdown, so maybe it's still not time to trust Lock against a respectable pass defense such as the Chargers.","A hard hit saw Ebron leave the field after just 10 offensive snaps this past Monday. It's unclear if Ebron will be cleared in time for a matchup with a solid Colts back seven. If active, Ebron merits a spot in lineups in deeper leagues given his usage and rapport with his quarterback. ","Kansas City kept Drew Brees in check last week in allowing just a 44.1% completion rate to the Canton-bound passer, the third-lowest rate of his career. The holdup is that the Chiefs netted just a single sack and have one-or-fewer sacks in four of the past five games."],"17":["Grinding out 68 scrimmage yards and a touchdown helped salvage Ekeler's fantasy production this past week against the Falcons. A stronger game could be on the way now that the Chiefs are likely to rest key defensive players, setting up this versatile back with a strong projection.","Grinding out a respectable fantasy showing in an ugly day for the Browns' offense this past weekend, Chubb has now scored in all but three appearances this season.

Landry was able to deliver a respectable showing a few weeks back against the Ravens, as he's the most bankable option in the team's passing game this week.","Hockenson's production was limited in Week 16 with Matthew Stafford out of the game.

Even though he's the Saints No. 1 receiver, Sanders is a flex play at best since the Saints will likely again rely on RB Alvin Kamara and not challenge a Panthers secondary allowing the 10th-fewest WR fantasy points per game.",null,"Without their top edge rushers on the field this past week and with negative fantasy results in two of the past four outings for this D/ST, it's wise to avoid this Denver defense for this final game of the season.","Samuel set season-highs with 53 rushing yards and 106 receiving yards, helping Carolina hold off Washington in Week 16. Samuel's dual-threat ability will come in handy in the Panthers finale as they'll be tasked with keeping pace with Drew Brees and a New Orleans club hoping to secure the NFC's best record and a first-round bye. Consider Samuel as a WR3/flex option in Week 17.","Dubiously tying Carson Wentz for the league lead in interceptions with his fifth performance of the season with multiple picks, Lock isn't a lock to help your fantasy rosters even against a subpar Raiders defense. Given the low floor, it's best to fade Lock in all leagues.","A clutch touchdown and solid target share helped Ebron produce a solid outing this past week against his former team. The Browns haven't been great in coverage this year, with Ebron positioned as a solid plug-and-play candidate.","With Kansas City intent on resting starters this week, per the coaching staff, it is risky to deploy this D/ST in a matchup with a Chargers team likely to send out its full offensive roster."],"10":[null,"Activated from injured reserve, Chubb is likely to return to the field from injury for Cleveland as early as this week. It would be quite the boon to his fantasy stock given Houston is among the softest rush defenses in the league. It's unclear what type of workload Chubb might handle if he's active, but the blend of talent and promising matchup serve to support high-end RB2 value.",null,"Higbee lagged behind Gerald Everett in the passing game in his return to action in Week 8, racking up only four targets to Everett's nine. It appears Higbee is no longer the top option at the position for Los Angeles, but the two are still splitting snaps, making neither particularly appealing against a Seattle defense that is woeful against wideouts but solid (fifth-fewest points per game allowed) against tight ends.",null,"Unable to get untracked against the Raiders a few weeks back as the Browns' top target, Landry's perch as the team's lone proven playmaker in the receiving corps should see a sizable surge in opportunity rates during the second half of the season for Cleveland. The Texans have yielded the 12th-most yards and seventh-most fantasy points per game to receivers, aligning to support starting fantasy value for Landry.","Hockenson has been emerging as a more consistent participant in the Detroit passing game, and with 24 targets over his past three games, it's safe to say he's become a regular. The second-year pro will face a Washington defense that's great against receivers but struggles against tight ends, giving him the potential to lead the Lions in receiving if Kenny Golladay remains out. He's one of the top tight end options for Week 10.","Johnson cut into Adrian Peterson's playing time a bit in Week 9 and could be emerging as a more consistent threat in the Detroit offense. He handled seven touches against Minnesota one week after scoring a touchdown against the Colts, so he's a name to watch for those seeking running back depth. However, D'Andre Swift still leads the backfield, so Johnson should not start in fantasy lineups in Week 10.","After missing two games, Sanders joined a returning Michael Thomas in Week 9, giving Drew Brees his top two wideouts for the first time since opening week. Sanders only garnered four receptions for 38 yards, but one found paydirt for his first touchdown since Week 3. Brees proclivity for short passes along with a receiving corps finally at full strength limit Sanders upside, but he's still in the running for a flex spot with San Francisco in town.",null,"With a total of seven fantasy points across the past three outings, Denver's D/ST simply hasn't helped managers lately. Given that Las Vegas has been great in protecting the pocket on offense, there isn't much fantasy fun to consider for this defense.","With nine grabs and 109 receiving yards, Samuel cleared the century mark for the first time this season, also chipping in with a rushing touchdown. With increased workload and output each of the last three weeks, it's apparent Samuel will have a role in the Panthers game plan. That said, he's still just a flex play as he'll be hard-pressed to duplicate Week 9's outburst this Sunday against a solid Tampa Bay defense.","Consecutive games with at least 19 fantasy points and multiple touchdowns has Lock rising in fantasy value heading into Week 10. While he hasn't been very efficient this season, Lock's ability to produce big downfield plays helps his case as a high-ceiling streamer (with an obviously low floor) this week against a Raiders defense allowing 21.1 fantasy points per game to passers, sixth most in the league.","The really strong usage rates Ebron enjoyed beginning in Week 3 have finally started surfacing in the box score, as he has now scored in consecutive weeks and is impressively tied with Jared Cook for the second-most receiving touchdowns among tight ends since 2018. The Bengals have been the second-easiest matchup for tight ends thus far this season, further evidence Ebron has entered the starting tier of the position this week.",null],"11":[null,"Chubb could have delivered a second touchdown in last week's win over Houston, but he chose to help the Browns kneel the game away. The return of Chubb to the offense proved successful, as it ended the team's seven quarter drought without a touchdown. The Eagles are up next and present a real challenge in that stopping the run is the team's defensive strength, but Chubb's blend of workload and talent keeps him in the RB2 mix.",null,"Higbee caught three passes for a season-high 60 yards in Week 10. However, he still lags last season's production. Week 11 offers Higbee a chance to make up some of the difference as the Rams head to Tampa Bay in a Monday night showdown. The Buccaneers defense allows the 14th-most TE fantasy points per game, so Higbee is a viable option if you need a spot-starter at the position.","Ryan went into the Falcons' Week 10 bye on a high note, coming off a 3-TD performance against the Broncos. The veteran signal-caller has had an extra week to prepare for a Saints defense sitting eighth in the league with 2.67 sacks per game. With Drew Brees out, New Orleans may look to play more ball control, rendering Ryan as a low-end QB1 for this NFC South road tilt.","The Browns basically abandoned the passing game in favor of a dominant rushing phase this past week, leaving Landry with just 17 routes in the win. With an expectation to lead the team in routes and targets in a favorable matchup with a reeling Philadelphia back seven, Landry makes for a worthy flex in deeper leagues this weekend.","Hockenson appeared to be in store for a big game in Week 10, facing a Washington defense allowing the seventh-most TE fantasy points, but \"The Football Team\" held Hockenson to just two catches for 13 yards. The Lions next face another unit vulnerable to tight ends, so expect a TE1-level rebound in this week's road tilt with the Panthers.","With D'Andre Swift taking over as the Lions' starting back in Week 10, Johnson became an afterthought, playing on just nine snaps with one rush for three yards. Week 11 brings a Panthers defense susceptible to the run, but with Swift handling the majority of backfield duties, Johnson won't likely see enough action to take advantage.","Sanders turned in a rare non-productive effort in the Saints' Week 10 win over San Francisco, catching his only target for five yards. Next on the slate is a juicy matchup against the Falcons, but with Drew Brees having been ruled out, Sanders is merely a deep-league flex candidate.",null,"This defense has netted negative fantasy production during the past three games and was kept out of the sack column entirely for the first time this season against Las Vegas this past Sunday. The Dolphins were once a sweet fantasy matchup, and there is still some appeal in facing a rookie passer, but this D/ST is really just a streaming candidate.","With Christian McCaffrey out, it finally felt safe to start Samuel after his recent stretch of fantasy-viable production. Unfortunately, he was stymied by a stout Tampa Bay defense, logging just three carries for eight yards and three catches for just four more. However, Week 11 should be a different story against the Lions who have surrendered the seventh-most scrimmage yards per game, making Samuel a worthy WR2/WR3 option.","It's not great when the most notable storyline for a passer is setting a new career high in interceptions, as Lock did last week. It's also not good that the young signal-caller took two sacks and netted just 5.5 per attempt against Las Vegas. Miami has allowed 18.8 fantasy points per game to opposing arms this season, but Lock's low completion rate and rising turnover rate signals too much risk for fantasy managers.","Notching just two catches isn't ideal, but this past week also saw Ebron net six targets in another big role for the Pittsburgh passing game. Given his ability to convert around the red zone and the Jaguars issues in coverage, Ebron merits interest as a streamer.","The upside with this group is fairly high, as the 21 fantasy points a few weeks ago in Denver reveals. The floor is also a bit low, though, with Carolina delivering negative fantasy results for the Chiefs last time out. Given how good Las Vegas has been at staving off pressure in the pocket as an offense, Kansas City enters this week as a somewhat risky defensive play. "],"6":[null,null,null,"Higbee held his playing-time advantage over Gerald Everett in Week 4 but did not translate that into production, as the latter racked up a team-high 90 receiving yards while Higbee settled for just 12 yards on two receptions. Everett has been the star tight end for this Rams offense in the past, and he might be coming back into frame as the player to start at the position for fantasy. The uncertainty, however, means neither is a great option this week against San Francisco.","For the first time since his rookie season, Ryan has gone two consecutive games without connecting on a scoring strike. Week 5 was his third straight subpar performance, though Ryan is in a good spot to rebound against a Vikings team allowing the sixth-most passing yards per game. Ryan's recent woes have dropped him to \"matchup status\" with the Week 6 date with Minnesota looking to be favorable.","A few bad drops kept Landry from enjoying a stronger showing in Week 5. That said, he led the team in air yards and posted respectable numbers against a strong defense, thus Landry exits the week looking good for this matchup with a Pittsburgh defense that simply can't stop receivers this season; the Steelers are allowing 44.5 fantasy points per game to receiving corps. ","Hockenson scored his second touchdown of the season in Week 4 but managed only two receptions for nine yards. That said, he has had eight-plus fantasy points in each of his first four games. By 2020 standards, that's solid for a low-end starting tight end. Jacksonville has allowed the ninth-most TE fantasy points per game this season, so Hockenson is a deep-league starting option for Week 6.","Johnson appears to be on the wrong end of the Detroit backfield depth chart, handling only 11 snaps in Week 4 and seeing only three rushing attempts in both of his last two appearances. Look to Adrian Peterson or D'Andre Swift if you'd like to start a Detroit back against the Jaguars in Week 6.",null,null,"The Broncos' pass rush finally surfaced in Week 4, generating six sacks after tallying just four in the first three weeks. New England is likely healthier on offense given the bye, thus Denver is a somewhat volatile streaming play against a run-heavy New England offense.","Samuel was one several Panthers to take advantage of the Falcons' weak defense with a season-best 54 scrimmage yards in the Week 5 victory in Atlanta. This week's foe, the Bears, sport a more formidable unit. As such, expect Samuel to return to relative obscurity.","Lock should be back behind center for this meeting with a motivated New England defense. With the Patriots just pushed around by the Chiefs in Week 4, their otherwise sound pass defense will look to right things against Denver's depleted passing attack. Simply put, New England's defense is likely too good for Denver's depleted passing game.","Since a quiet debut with Pittsburgh, Ebron has ranked second on the team in routes run and is second in targets during this three-game sample. The Browns, meanwhile, have allowed 17.6 fantasy points per game to tight ends this season, sixth most in the league. Rising usage and an inviting matchup help Ebron surface as a capable streaming option this week.","Entering the week with the league's fourth-highest pressure and sack rates on defense, the Chiefs have a fairly strong pass defense, but struggle with the run. The Bills enter with a solid offense capable of leaning on the run to move the ball, which serves to downgrade this defense into the streaming tier for Week 6."],"7":[null,null,null,"Higbee continues to hold a playing-time advantage over Gerald Everett, but lately that has not translated into a meaningful advantage in rems of fantasy output. With no touchdowns since a three-score outburst in Week 2, Higbee has fallen out of the ranks of the starting fantasy tight ends. He should be benched for Week 7 against Chicago.","The combination of a healthy Julio Jones returning, the debut of interim coach Raheem Morris, and a weak Vikings secondary all seemed to return Ryan to the form that netted him the 2016 MVP. In Week 6, Ryan threw for 371 yards and four touchdowns without a pick. Next up is Detroit, which ranks mid-pack in terms of yielding yards through the air. However, the Lions are dealing with multiple injuries in the secondary and are averaging less than one sack per game. When Ryan has time, he's usually effective. He's a solid QB1 this week.","A short average depth of target of 8.2 yards this past week limited the damage Landry could do against a stingy pass defense. It helps then that this next opponent struggles against slot weapons like Landry, setting him up for real success as a flex option in Week 7.","Hockenson has found paydirt three times in five games, so while his yardage total (26 yards over his last two games) doesn't impress, his ability to find the end zone is becoming somewhat reliable. Add to that a Falcons defense allowing the second-most TE fantasy points per game and Hockenson makes for a very good plug-and-play tight end in Week 7.","Johnson appears to be the \"odd man out\" in the Detroit backfield, with Adrian Peterson and D'Andre Swift combining for 29 carries and over 150 yards (with three touchdowns) in Week 6. Meanwhile, Johnson had just nine yards on four attempts. Until this balance changes, Johnson can be moved to the waiver wire in most fantasy leagues.","Sanders took advantage of Michael Thomas' suspension in Week 5, setting new highs in a Saints uniform with 12 grabs for 122 yards. With the potential return of Thomas for Week 7, Sanders' target share would likely have suffered as New Orleans returns from the bye to host Carolina. Unfortunately, it's a moot point as the receiver has been placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list. ",null,"A surge in sack production helped the Broncos shut down the New England offense last week. Things are a bit different this week, however, as the indominable Kansas City offense is on deck. Given how well Patrick Mahomes has played against Denver in recent meetings, it's safe to fade this D/ST in all formats.  ","After practicing on a limited basis with a sore knee, Samuel was inactive for the Panthers' Week 6 contest with the Bears. He's questionable for this week's encounter with the Saints but, even if he suits up, he's not in the fantasy picture.","Lock's film looks better than his numbers do from Week 6, but that's really just a relative distinction. Denver dropped at least three of Lock's passes, one of them in the end zone. This said, Lock isn't in a good spot this week facing a Chiefs defense that sports the second-highest pressure rate among defenses. ","The production hasn't been very good just yet, but the role remains fairly intriguing; Ebron continues to see plenty of routes and targets in this offense, but just hasn't gotten untracked. The Titans have allowed 15.6 fantasy points per game to tight ends in ESPN PPR scoring, evidence Ebron could emerge as a factor in this outing of AFC powers. ","Second in the NFL in pressuring passers, the Chiefs are in a solid spot this week against a mistake-prone young Denver passer. Denver simply isn't proving efficient passing the ball, which plays into this ball-hawking defense's agenda."],"8":[null,null,null,"Even after getting in limited practice to end the week, Higbee was held out of the Rams' win over the Bears on Monday. As a gametime decision, he figures to be ready for Week 8 against Miami, but his status in the Rams' offense was already in question due to the re-emergence of Gerald Everett as a threat in the passing game. Avoid the headache and look elsewhere for your starting tight end in fantasy this week.","It's not a coincidence that Ryan's resurgence piggybacked Julio Jones' healthy return to the Atlanta lineup as the veteran passed for 338 yards, connecting on 31-of-42 attempts and a score. Ryan faces a short turnaround as the Falcons visit Carolina in this week's Thursday night contest. Ryan is playable but you should consider someone with a more favorable matchup as the Panthers defense has allowed the sixth fewest QB fantasy points.","Unable to capitalize in a game that saw the Browns score five times in the air, Landry still figures to lead the team in targets for the rest of the way with Odell Beckham Jr. out for the season. This matchup against the Raiders is decidedly friendly for fantasy purposes; Las Vegas has allowed the 10th-most points per game to receivers. ","In Week 7, Hockenson scored for the third straight game and the fourth time in six games in 2020. More importantly, he tied his season-high with five receptions against the Falcons. The bad news? It was against the Falcons, the worst TE defense in the NFL. The Colts have the best defense against the position in terms of suppressing fantasy points, meaning Hockenson is a very risky low-end starting option in Week 8.","Johnson did get on the field in Week 7 but did not see any of the 25 touches that went to running backs in the contest against the Falcons. That's as good of a sign as any to send him to the bench (or even the waiver wire) for Week 8 against a very good Colts defense.","Sanders tested positive for COVID-19 prior to Week 7's contest and, since he was symptomatic, the earliest he is eligible to return is Week 9 when New Orleans visits Tampa Bay in an important NFC South tussle.",null,"A strong pass rush has produced 14 sacks the past three games for Denver. Working in this group's favor for streaming value is the fact the Chargers have allowed the third-highest pressure rate on their passers in the leagues. Even as Justin Herbert is a special talent, facing a rookie passer behind a leaky line could help Denver's D/ST.","In Week 7, Samuel enjoyed his best game of the season, rushing for a 5-yard touchdown along with securing all six of his targets for 48 yards. The four-year pro will continue to see time as a wide receiver and running back, but not enough to trust as a fantasy option.","Lock still hasn't reached 14 fantasy points in a game this season. So that's not very good. This next matchup does present some upside for Lock in that only the Falcons and Seahawks are allowing more fantasy points per game to passers than the Chargers. Los Angeles has some playmakers on defense and Lock hasn't been efficient yet this year, so he's still pretty far away from starting in single quarterback formats.","The big game hasn't really surfaced yet, but Ebron is being sent a solid batch of targets most weeks and is often third on the team in routes each time out. The Ravens are solid in coverage, thus Ebron is merely a streaming option among tight ends this week. ","Producing a pick-six and a return score in first half last week, the Chiefs' D/ST showed up in a big way. Things look even better this week as Kansas City faces a Jets offense that has been mistake-prone all season. It's rare for a D/ST to truly merit must-start status, but this one qualifies."],"9":[null,null,null,null,"Ryan needed to put the ball up only 30 times last Thursday, a season low. Even so, he threw for a healthy 281 yards on 21 completions, also scoring his first rushing touchdown of the year. Ryan lines up as a low-end QB1 when the Broncos visit Atlanta on Sunday. Denver has yielded the 10th-most QB fantasy points so far this season.",null,"Hockenson helped fill the void left by the injured Kenny Golladay in Week 8, handling a season-high 10 targets and setting 2020 bests in both catches and yards. That's great news heading out of a matchup against the best defense in the NFL (Colts) and into one against a very mediocre defense (Vikings). With so few viable options at the TE position in 2020, Hockenson is elevated to must-start status with Golladay likely out and his volume and role in the offense steadily increasing.","Johnson did catch a TD pass in Week 8, but D'Andre Swift has been productive enough in the passing game and Adrian Peterson is a better rusher off the bench, leaving Johnson in a very tricky spot to earn meaningful playing time. He'll need things to change on the depth chart to merit a start in fantasy -- and that's not expected for Week 9.","Sanders is expected to meet the necessary protocols and be taken off the reserve/COVID-19 list after having missed two games. He last played in Week 5, as the Saints had a bye the following week. In that contest, he caught a season-high 12 balls for 122 yards. Sanders profiles as a WR3/flex in his return as he'll face a stingy Buccaneers secondary in Week 9.",null,"This D/ST has produced just one game above six fantasy points all season and next faces an Atlanta team on the road in a game with a point total hovering around 50 as the game approaches. ","Samuel found paydirt twice -- once on the ground and the other on the business end of a 27-yard flea-flicker -- in Week 8's Thursday encounter with Atlanta. Samuel took advantage of Christian McCaffrey's absence to record 54 scrimmage yards. However, with the Panthers' No. 1 back expected to return in Week 9, Samuel's contributions as a receiver out of the backfield will be significantly reduced. He shouldn't be a factor this week against the Chiefs' tough pass defense.","In becoming the first Broncos player to throw three passing scores in a fourth quarter win since Peyton Manning back in December of 2013, Lock delivered one of the better games of his career against the Chargers in a dramatic comeback win in Week 8. Lock should prove aggressive in attacking Atlanta's suspect secondary deep down the field. The Falcons, have allowed the most fantasy points per game to signal-callers, aiding Lock's case as a high-ceiling streaming option in deeper formats.","Finally producing solid fantasy results after weeks of netting respectable usage rates in this offense, Ebron is emerging as a worthy plug-and-play option at a fickle position.

received a contract extension, and former running mate Melvin Gordon is now in Denver, which locks in the former as the Chargers' lead back in 2020. Ekeler took his game to a new level last season, especially as a receiver, ranking no lower than second among backs in targets, receptions, yards and touchdowns. Despite Gordon playing a substantial role in 12 games, Ekeler was fantasy's No. 4 scoring back. Ekeler's small frame will limit his carries and goal-line work (he's never cleared 132 carries or three rushing touchdowns in a season), and he's unlikely to repeat a 91-992-8 receiving line with Tyrod Taylor and Justin Herbert under center. Expect a step back for Ekeler, though his role can still allow borderline RB1 production in PPR.","Chubb has emerged as one of the league's most-effective rushers since being selected in the second round of the 2018 draft. He ranks first in YPC (5.1) and second in YAC (2.3) among 25 backs with at least 300 carries during that span. Chubb was fantasy's No. 8 scoring back in 2019, thanks to the fourth-most touches and second-most total yardage at the position. However, we can't ignore that Chubb's usage and fantasy production dipped once Kareem Hunt returned from suspension (RB6 before, RB15 after). Hunt will be in the mix from the get-go in 2020, which will certainly limit Chubb's output. Consider Chubb a borderline top-10 RB with more value in non-PPR leagues.","The Broncos selected Sutton in the second round of the 2018 draft with the hope that he might emerge as their No. 1 wide receiver. He did exactly that in his second season, posting a 72-1,112-6 receiving line en route to a 19th-place fantasy finish. Sutton was terrific after the catch (5.0 RAC), reliable (only two drops on 124 targets), and productive despite some bad touchdown luck (6 TD, 7.2 OTD). Since entering the league, Sutton ranks sixth in the NFL with 23 end-zone targets. The progression of Noah Fant and the arrival of Melvin Gordon, Jerry Jeudy and KJ Hamler may cost Sutton a few targets, but the 24-year-old will handle enough work to allow for WR2 production.","If someone told you midway through the 2019 season that Higbee was a solid TE1 fantasy option going forward, you would've laughed. The 2016 fourth-round pick had totaled an 86-884-5 receiving line in 58 games through Week 12 of last season. He went on to produce a 43-522-2 line while averaging 11.4 targets per game the rest of the season. Higbee was the top-scoring fantasy TE by 23 points during the span. The 27-year-old signed a contract extension last year and Sean McVay's adjustment to more '12' personnel late last season suggests Higbee's emergence was no fluke. Higbee is best-viewed as mid-range TE1.","Ryan's bizarre roller-coaster career continued in 2019, as his 11th-place fantasy campaign means he has finished outside the top 10 QBs in fantasy points during odd years and no lower than seventh in even years, going all the way back to 2012. In Ryan's defense, he missed a game (his first since 2009) and still played well, ranking top-nine in completion percentage for the eighth consecutive season. Ryan also paced all QBs in completions (408) and finished top-six in passing yards for the 10th straight season. Operating in Dirk Koetter's high-volume offense with Julio Jones, Calvin Ridley, Todd Gurley and five first-round picks on the offensive line, Ryan has a high floor and is a fringe QB1.","Landry was expected to see a big dip in production last season following the Browns' trade for Odell Beckham Jr. Instead, Cleveland's slot man had one of his best NFL seasons and actually out-targeted his teammate 139-132. Landry set a career-high in receiving yardage (1,174) and YPR (14.1) en route to his fifth consecutive top-18 fantasy campaign. Landry has proved to be super reliable, having never missed a game in six seasons and checking in as one of just six players who were targeted in 100% of his 2019 games. New coach Kevin Stefanski could shake things up a bit, but Landry's connection with Baker Mayfield is solid, making him a fine WR3 target.","It's rare for a rookie tight end to make much noise in fantasy, so Hockenson's 32-367-2 line after being selected eighth overall in the 2019 draft should not be viewed as a knock. The Iowa product showed his upside with a 6-131-1 showing in his NFL debut, but managed double-digit fantasy points in only one additional game and missed the final four games due to injury. The 23-year-old is a strong bet for more work in his second season and, as usual for second-year tight ends, will come fairly cheap in the double-digit rounds. Hockenson has the upside to become one of the next great all-around tight ends.","Johnson enters his third NFL season no longer a clear feature back after Detroit drafted D'Andre Swift in the second round. Johnson impressed as a second-round rookie in 2018, averaging 5.4 YPC and catching 84% of his targets, but missed six games. During another injury-plagued campaign in 2019, his receiving workload and rushing efficiency took a hard hit (3.6 YPC) in eight games as Detroit's primary rusher, though he was providing RB2 production prior to a Week 7 injury. Johnson is only 23 years old, but the presence of the more-dynamic Swift is sure to limit his touches. Consider Johnson a flex with limited upside.","Sanders is now 33, but the veteran receiver is well-situated for another season of fantasy relevance after signing with the high-scoring Saints. Sanders is no longer the target hog he was during his prime, but he has nonetheless managed a pair of top-30 fantasy campaigns over the past two seasons. Sanders has seen top-10 finishes in catch rate in both of the past two seasons and figures to work as one of Drew Brees' top targets in the short-to-intermediate area behind Michael Thomas. Sanders is unlikely to be a major asset near the goal line, as he has cleared six touchdowns in a season just once in his career. Nevertheless, he'll see enough volume to warrant weekly flex consideration.","Prater just continues to get the job done. Five of his past eight seasons have resulted in a top-10 fantasy campaign, including three of the past four. Once adjusted for distance, Prater trails only Justin Tucker in field goal accuracy over the past five seasons. He has been cash money from deep, converting on 47 of 61 attempts from 50-plus yards over the past decade; that 77.0% rate is tops in the league during that span. Prater is entering his age-36 season but remains a solid fantasy starter in a Lions offense that figures to improve with a healthy Matthew Stafford.","The Broncos' D/ST has finished in the upper half of the league in fantasy points eight of the past nine seasons and, though 2019 was the exception, there is reason for optimism that Vic Fangio's unit will make a leap in 2020. Denver struggled with big plays last season (27th in forced turnovers and one touchdown), but ranked 12th or better in both yardage and points allowed. The offseason additions of Jurrell Casey and A.J. Bouye, as well as a return to health for Bradley Chubb and Bryce Callahan, more than offset the losses of Chris Harris and Derek Wolfe. Add that to a core that includes Von Miller, Justin Simmons, Kareem Jackson and unheralded AJ Johnson, and the Denver D/ST has the look of a fantasy starter in 2020.","Samuel's career advanced another step last season as the 2017 second-round pick appeared in 16 games for the first time in his career and posted career-high totals in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns. His efficiency wasn't good (51% catch rate, 5.9 YPT), although some of that can be blamed on a 28% off-target rate (eighth highest in the NFL). Samuel did finish as 2019's No. 26 fantasy WR, thanks in part to his also being a factor as a rusher (19-130-1 on the ground). He is sure to sustain a significant role in Matt Rhule's new-look offense, but Carolina's signing of Robby Anderson is sure to cost Samuel targets. As such, he's only a flex option in deeper leagues.","The Denver defense is in excellent shape behind defensive-minded coach Vic Fangio, so the pressure will be on the second-year Lock to get this team back to the playoffs. The 2019 second-round pick failed to make much noise in five starts as a rookie, averaging a weak 6.5 YPA and managing only one weekly fantasy finish better than 20th. Denver is expected to continue leaning on a run-first offense, though Lock's supporting cast is looking much better after the team added Melvin Gordon, Jerry Jeudy and KJ Hamler to a group that already included Courtland Sutton, Noah Fant and Phillip Lindsay. Not a huge factor as a rusher, Lock figures to be limited to mid-to-back-end QB2 production, though he's an obvious deep sleeper in his second season.","Ebron signed with the Steelers after spending the first six seasons of his career in Detroit and Indianapolis. The 2014 first-round pick underachieved during his time with the Lions, but a breakout season in 2018 saw him post a 66-750-13 receiving line. He crashed back to earth last season thanks to predictable regression to the mean, but also due to the loss of Andrew Luck, posting a 31-375-3 line in 11 games. Now with Pittsburgh, the 27-year-old figures to work ahead of Vance McDonald as the team's top receiving tight end. Ebron is best-viewed as a mid-to-back-end TE2.","The Kansas City defense took a big leap forward under Steve Spagnuolo last season and it resulted in an 11th-place fantasy finish for the team's D/ST. The Chiefs haven't finished worse than ninth in interceptions since 2014 or worse than 10th in D/ST touchdowns since 2012. They haven't finished in the upper half of the league in yardage allowed since 2015, but did jump to eighth in points allowed in 2019. Kansas City's defense definitely doesn't pop on paper, but a solid 2019 unit will return its top 11 snap-getters this season. That group includes one of the league's elite players in Chris Jones, as well as stars Tyrann Mathieu and Frank Clark. Led by Tyreek Hill and Mecole Hardman, the Chiefs have at least one kick or punt return touchdown each of the past four seasons.

If you have him on your team and he's slated to play, you start him. Congratulations if you were fortunate enough to draft the Stanford product for your fantasy team. Keep him locked into your lineup for Week 1's contest with the Raiders.","Missing time and missing the end zone held Adams back from the upper echelon of fantasy wideouts in 2019, but his volume and production were still there when he was healthy. His 17.7 points per game total was the second-best of his career and he's still Green Bay's best WR option heading into 2020. The Vikings were among the top-10 most-generous WR fantasy defenses a year ago, so lock in Adams with confidence for Week 1.","With a big new contract on the books, Watson can clearly focus on curating the Houston offense sans his security blanket DeAndre Hopkins. The Chiefs got the better of Watson and the Texans in the playoffs last season, but the Clemson product's unique dual-threat ability keeps him firmly in the starting tier at the position.","Kupp finished the 2019 season on an incredible run of scoring touchdowns. He found paydirt in each of the final five games of the campaign. However, his volume fell off after a promising start, and he took a step back from WR1 status to settle into more of a mid-range fantasy receiver. He remains in that same sort of role heading into his third season. Consider Kupp to be a worthy WR3/flex in Week 1 against a middling Dallas pass defense.","The rare complementary tailback to claim independent fantasy value, Hunt's ability to thrive as a receiving threat on third downs vaults him into the flex tier among tailbacks. The Ravens, however, yielded just 28.4 receiving yards per game to backs last season, third fewest in the league. Given the tough matchup, deploying Hunt in lineups comes with some additional risk.","We have to go back to 2017 for Green's last full season and 1,000-yard effort. With last year's lost season in the rearview, Green enters 2020 with a minor hamstring concern, although tons of potential given a new pairing with an exciting young quarterback. For this first matchup, Green nets a difficult matchup with the Chargers' solid tandem of corners, leaving him in the flex tier among receivers.","Buzz about Dobbins impressing throughout the offseason could help the rookie see the field early for Baltimoreâ€™s run-centric offense. Still likely third in line for meaningful rushing chances behind both his quarterback and fellow tailback Mark Ingram II, it's best to be patient and not deploy Dobbins in lineups just yet for this division matchup with Cleveland.","A somewhat quiet 1,000-yard rushing effort from Lindsay in 2019 should help his case as a busy change-of-pace option alongside Melvin Gordon in the Denver backfield. With Gordon likely to have the lead for valuable goal-to-go and receiving work, Lindsay is found just off the fringe of flex value heading into a matchup with a solid Titans defense.","Slayton found his way to the end zone eight times as a rookie, but went over 100 yards only twice and scored five-or-fewer fantasy points in 50% of his 14 games played. He's definitely a boom-or-bust receiver. Against a solid Pittsburgh defense, it's not wise to bet on a boom in Week 1. Keep him on your bench for now.","A fun usage profile from last season saw the Penn State product enjoy a robust average depth of target of 10.1 yards downfield. While a sluggish catch rate accompanied this healthy aDOT, there is some potential for Gesicki to develop into a seam-busting tight end this season. Unfortunately, this first matchup proves unfriendly given the Patriots allowed the seventh-fewest fantasy points to the position last year.","Will we ever see the 2018 version of Jared Goff again? The Rams' signal-caller was impressive during the team's Super Bowl run but failed to recreate the same magic last year. His offense looks a lot different heading into 2020 with no Todd Gurley II or Brandin Cooks, but you shouldn't ignore that he started to develop some great chemistry with TEs Tyler Higbee and Gerald Everett late last year. Goff isn't quite at the QB1 level in fantasy, but keep an eye on him if you're looking to mix-and-match at the position in 2020.","The selling point for Hooper as a fantasy option begins with consecutive seasons as a top-10 receiving threat at his positions. The downside is the fact Hooper joins a new offense with potential competition for targets and routes from incumbent tight end David Njoku. Given an impressive track record, Hooper qualifies as a starting fantasy option even while facing a solid Ravens defense that allowed the second-fewest yards to tight ends last year.",null,"Seattle's D/ST is not what it once was, and in a road game on the other side of the country, it's probably best to look elsewhere for your Week 1 starter at the position.","Jackson appears to be the top receiver for the Eagles who happens to be healthy heading into Week 1, which provides him with a huge opportunity against a Washington defense that isn't exactly difficult to pass the ball against. Jackson has never been known for his consistency, but there should be plenty of opportunities in Week 1. That means he's well worth a spot in your fantasy lineup as a WR3/flex option."],"2":["Yawn! Week after week, opposing defenses know the Panthers will feed McCaffrey, yet the top fantasy running back always seems to get it done. In the opener, his value came via a pair of rushing touchdowns as he was held in check in the passing game with just three catches for 38 yards. Always a must-start, look for McCaffrey to become even more involved in the aerial game in a Week 2 matchup with an improving Tampa Bay defense.","Adams surprised no one by leading the Packers in targets, receptions and yards in Week 1, ending up as Aaron Rodgers' top target, just like he was for all of last season when healthy. This is the sort of output we should expect from Adams nearly every week and, with the Detroit secondary looking a bit banged up heading into Week 2, the Green Bay receiver is an easy pick as your WR1.","Watson faced nearly endless pressure against the Chiefs in the opener, with Kansas City registering a whopping 45% pressure rate on his dropbacks. The Ravens had the fourth-highest blitz rate of Week 1, adding some risk to Watson's profile, but he's also among the most productive rushing and roll-out playmakers in the league. With his playmaking pedigree on his side, Watson can overcome the challenging matchup.","Kupp finished second to Robert Woods in every key statistical category in Week 1, but still played as a starter and is in the mix as a top fantasy WR option given his track record. Against an Eagles team that finished among the worst in preventing wide receiver fantasy scoring in 2019, he's a solid Week 2 starting option in all leagues.","Out-snapping and earning more touches than Nick Chubb in Week 1 confirmed Hunt's big role on the Browns this season. The Bengals weren't challenged much in the air by the Chargers' backfield, but Hunt should prove busy in such a role this week.","Maybe it was the result of a recent injury in training camp, but Green was third among Bengals receivers in snaps and routes in Week 1. Then again, he had a team-high nine targets and almost secured a big touchdown on an underthrown ball. The Browns are banged up in the secondary, helping Green's profile as a WR2 candidate in Week 2.","A multi-score debut was undeniably impressive, as was leading the backfield with a presence on 40% of offensive snaps in Week 1. While he didn't field a target, Dobbins led the backfield with 14 routes run and was also a meaningful presence in the red zone. With a fairly evenly split committee formed with Mark Ingram, it's not yet time to start Dobbins in lineups, even as Baltimore meets a Houston team that struggled against the rush last week. ","An injury saw Lindsay limited in Week 1, but his snap and touch rate was at least promising. Less promising is this difficult matchup with the Steelers, one of the better rush defenses in the league. ","Slayton rewarded those seeking breakout potential with a stellar Week 1, gathering in 6-of-9 targets for 102 yards and a pair of scores. The second-year wideout is a legitimate deep and red-zone presence on a team where defenses will be preoccupied by Saquon Barkley. Despite the opening week performance, Slayton isnâ€™t quite yet established enough to be placed in fantasy lineups. However, adding him as a reserve would be prudent.","A quick look at the box score from this past week doesn't seem so impressive for Gesicki; the Penn State product netted just 30 yards, after all. But looking deeper into his usage, he played out of the slot for 32 snaps, which is a big rate for a tight end in a league-wide context. The Bills have been solid against tight ends over the past year, though, leaving Gesicki as more of a fringe fantasy consideration.","Goff failed to find the end zone with any of his throws or rushing attempts in Week 1, but his underlying stats (65% completions, 8.9 YPA) were solid. The Eagles do not represent a great matchup, as they were an average pass defense a season ago and performed well in Week 1, so it's best to leave the Rams' passer on your bench or waivers in fantasy this week.","Given just two targets despite ranking second in routes run for the Browns this past week was disappointing. An injury to David Njoku could spell more targets for Hooper, but an ugly opener leaves him on the fringe of starting value entering a meeting with a Bengals defense that struggles to contain tight ends.",null,"The Legion of Boom days are long gone, and this is no longer a fantasy D/ST to trust. This unit failed to net positive fantasy points in Week 1 and face a solid New England offense in Week 2. Look elsewhere for your starter at the position.","Jackson was targeted seven times but managed just two receptions for 46 yards. The Washington defense did a good job shutting down the Eagles offense after Philadelphia jumped out to an early lead, pressuring Carson Wentz so he couldnâ€™t look downfield. Jacksonâ€™s game hinges on his ability to stretch the field and with the Eagles facing another strong pass rush (Rams) in Week 2, he's best suited for best-ball leagues. Using him in traditional formats is too risky."],"3":["Those expending a top pick on McCaffrey received bad news as the star running back has a high-ankle sprain, with an estimated return time of  4-6 weeks.","Adams suffered a hamstring injury in Week 2 against the Lions, but it appears he avoided a serious setback and could be good to go for Week 3. Keep a close eye on his status, as that will be the only reason you'd keep him out of your fantasy lineup. The Saints were one of the weakest teams against wideouts last season (sixth-most fantasy points allowed to the position) so, despite a solid start to 2020, Adams would still be a must-play here if healthy.","The Steelers have one of the pressure rates on defense in the past decade to begin a season. This proves troublesome for any offense, but especially a Houston line that has struggled to protect Watson over the years. Watson has clearly continued to produce strong fantasy results even with a porous line, but this week could prove particularly challenging given the opponent.","Kupp hit 100 total yards in Week 2 but failed to find the end zone, continuing a worrying trend for the former fantasy star. The Bills have a solid pass defense, tied for fifth last season in fewest WR fantasy points allowed, so there's reason to doubt Kupp's viability as a solid starter at receiver. Consider him as more of a flex pick for Week 3.","Another awesomely efficient showing for Hunt included 8.6 yards per rush and seven total first downs on 12 touches. Surely part of the game plan for this meeting with an exploitable Washington defense, Hunt is a fine flex with upside for more.","Green was the targeted receiver on 10 incompletions this past Thursday, the first time in his career he was the target on that many incompletions. The 13 targets is a good thing, the three completions isn't as fun. With promise for some positive regression in working with Joe Burrow, Green is a solid flex for this meeting with the Eagles' exploitable secondary.","Still just serving a change-of-pace role, Dobbins maximized his three touches in Week 2 for 61 scrimmage yards. But with Gus Edwards consuming valuable snaps, Dobbins can't be trusted ahead of a friendly matchup with the Chiefs.",null,"Slayton's Week 2 production dropped significantly as the Bears defend the deep ball well, which is Slayton's bread and butter. It could be another rough week against the tough San Francisco pass defense. Even with the Giants likely putting the ball in the air more without Saquon Barkley, Slayton is no more than a flex option, reliant on a big play or two to come up big.","Busting seams as the key playmaker over the middle for Miami, Gesicki tallied a career showing in Week 2. A strong third outing is quite possible given Jacksonville's issues in coverage in the back seven.","Goff remains an efficient, effective quarterback who lacks fantasy appeal due to his low ceiling. He delivered a trio of touchdowns in Week 2 against the Eagles, but threw for only 267 yards. Since he offers no threat with his legs, either, there are always going to be better options out there. Goff is a safe source of points but not a truly worthy fantasy QB1 against a solid Buffalo pass defense.","The results haven't been very fun just yet, but we can say Hooper is on the field plenty thus far for the Browns. Likely due for some big plays give his share of the offense, Hooper is in the streaming tier among tight ends heading into Week 3's meeting with a suspect secondary.",null,"The Seahawks have not produced positive D/ST fantasy points through two games, and a matchup with Dallas doesn't offer much hope for breaking that trend. Keep this D/ST out of your lineup for Week 3.","Jackson's fantasy utility revolves around his making big plays. Thus far, he and Carson Wentz have been unable to make any downfield connections. This week is as good as it gets for a rebound with the Eagles hosting Cincinnati. Receivers like Jackson with a low floor are always risky, however his upside makes him a strong WR3/flex candidate in Week 3."],"4":["McCaffrey remains on the injured list with a high-ankle sprain. The earliest he can return is Week 6, at home against the Bears.","Adams has been dealing with a hamstring injury and tweeted this morning that he was not going to be on the field tonight. ","We saw Watson deliver solid numbers this past week, but he was also sacked five times and chased around for much of the outing. Watson has now been sacked at least five times in 11 outings sine 2017, most in the NFL. It's helps, then, that the Vikings are 31st in sack rate and leaky to receivers at the moment.","The Cooper Kupp we remember so fondly returned in Week 3, hauling in 9-of-10 targets and scoring a touchdown in a high-scoring contest with the Bills. Kupp has been inconsistent for most of the past year, but the upside is still there. With a decent Giants pass defense up in Week 4, Kupp is a solid WR2 pick in all leagues.","Hunt became the third Browns back in the past decade with consecutive games with a receiving score. A blend of high-leverage touches and elite efficiency somehow supports legitimate RB2 value for Hunt. You can expect this gifted back to serve a rewarding dual-threat role against a Dallas team that has struggled badly in pass defense.  ","Yet to really connect with Joe Burrow on a steady basis, Green's slow start is likely due to a series of factors such as rust and a lack of chemistry with his rookie partner. That said, Green is in a good spot to deliver flex value facing a Jaguars secondary that proves suspect to outside receiving threats.","Productive as a receiving threat in Week 3 yet without much usage as a rusher just yet, Dobbins isn't worth playing until his role expands. Washington has been respectable against backfields, so it's easier to avoid Dobbins given these matchup metrics.","Due to serve a sizable role if healthy enough, but for now it appears Melvin Gordon claims the more valuable role of the two heading into a nice matchup with the Jets. Without much clarity about his role on a short week, it's wise to wait and see with Lindsay. ","Slayton caught three balls for a team-high 53 yards in New York's Week 3 loss to the 49ers. With Sterling Shepard still out this week, Slayton should continue to be one of Daniel Jones' primary targets. Slayton registers as a WR3/flex type against a defense ranked as the 12th-most generous in WR yards allowed this season, albeit with only one touchdown.","He only hauled in one of his three targets in Week 3, but made the most of it with a touchdown. It remains notable that Gesicki often is near the team lead for average depth of target, aiding his ceiling for this matchup with a soft Seattle secondary.","Goff had himself a big game in Week 3 against the Bills, racking up 300 yards for the first time this season and scoring three times. We know Goff has potential to be a great fantasy quarterback, but we haven't seen it often enough over the past year. With so many other options and a decent Giants defense up in Week 4 (10th-fewest QB fantasy points allowed), it's a bit too risky to give him the starting spot in your fantasy lineup.","Yet to see the type of rewarding work that led to his breakout year in Atlanta last season, Hooper handled just four targets and 1.5 air yards per target in this past week's win. The Cowboys have allowed 16.5 fantasy points per game in PPR formats to tight ends, helping Hooper's case as a streaming target.",null,"Three takeaways helped the Seahawks provide a decent D/ST return in Week 3 but, for the most part, this is not a great pick given the 80 scoreboard points allowed through three weeks with only five total sacks. That said, the mistake-prone Dolphins are up next, which could provide spot-start value for those looking for a one-week option at the D/ST spot.","Jackson was unable to return for the second half in Sunday's contest, injuring his hamstring after having caught two passes for a tepid 11 yards against the Bengals. Even if he plays this week, Jackson is likely to be hobbled, taking away much of his big-play ability. That said, with the San Francisco defense also banged-up, Jackson could be considered as a flex option in deep leagues."],"6":["McCaffrey is eligible to return from the IR for Carolina's Week 6 contest with the Vikings. He's set to undergo tests on his high-ankle sprain to determine his availability, but it's probably wise to prepare for him to sit this one out.","Keep a close eye on the injury reports this week, because a healthy Adams goes straight into all lineups. The Green Bay offense has been performing well with or without him this season, but he sees such incredible volume and will surely become the focal point of the team once again if he plays. Consider him a top-end WR1 against Tampa Bay, if healthy.","Watson enters Week 6 with some real momentum; the dynamic dual-threat has produced at least 300 yards passing in two straight and has multiple passing scores in three straight outings. The rival Titans entered Week 5 with the third-highest pressure rate on opposing passers, so the matchup adds some degree of risk. Then again, Watson's ability to create on unscheduled plays out of the pocket remains remarkable, keeping him in the starting mix for fantasy purposes.","Kupp failed to find the end zone in Week 5, but did see a team-high eight targets and posted a decent outing for those in PPR leagues. He remains the top receiver for Los Angeles in terms of volume this season, but Jared Goff and the rest of these Rams have not had a very high ceiling in the passing game in 2020. As such, Kupp is recommended as only a WR2 against San Francisco's suddenly vulnerable defense, as evidenced by the strong showing against the 49ers by Miami last week.","Even as the Colts have been among the toughest matchups for backs, Hunt delivered a strong fantasy showing thanks to securing a big workload. With a snap rate roughly around 70% and a presence on all six of the Browns' goal-to-goal snaps in Week 5, Hunt's new role with Nick Chubb injured suggests some bigger games are on the way. The Steelers are allowing the fourth-fewest fantasy points per game to backfields, but Hunt's consolidation of rushing, receiving, and goal-line touches keeps him firmly in the RB1 tier.","Sent a single target before leaving the game with a hamstring injury soon after the half, Green's already troubling start to the season just got a bit uglier. Meanwhile, only the Rams have allowed fewer yards to receivers than the Colts, adding risk to a player who is difficult to trust in lineups.","Taking his only carry for 34 yards and also proving effective as a receiver, Dobbins continued to shine in a limited role in Week 5. The key work is limited, as the team continues to allocate more snaps and touches to Gus Edwards than Dobbins. While he would become a very exciting fantasy prospect as the lead back in Baltimore, Dobbins' current perch as a change-of-pace option keeps him on the pine heading into a meeting with an Eagles' defense built to stop the run.","Still on the mend, Lindsay's return would likely see him handle around 10 touches as a complementary option to Melvin Gordon. The Patriots are allowing nearly 4.4 yards per rush to backs, but Lindsay isn't likely to see the ball enough to cash in on the matchup.","Slayton is responsible for the Giants only TD catches, both occurring in the season opener. Last week, he was busy reeling in eight spirals for 129 yards, accounting for over half of Daniel Jones' passing yards. Washington's secondary has allowed the sixth-fewest passing yards per game, but is also tied for the sixth-most WR scores per game. Add it all up and Slayton's volume lands him in the WR3 range this week.","A sluggish snap rate of just 45% in Week 5 isn' ideal for fantasy purposes, but Gesicki maximized his opportunities nevertheless. It's worth noting that Gesicki is rarely asked to block and was only off the field for five of Ryan Fitzpatrick's dropbacks this past Sunday, aiding his case as a receiving threat heading into an inviting matchup with a depleted Jets defense. ","Goff picked up a rushing touchdown in Week 5 (paired with an embarrassing attempted spike) to bolster his fantasy output, but it was still a solid showing for the Los Angeles passer. With over 300 yards and a pair of scores, Goff continued a strong season which sees him among the top-10 scorers at quarterback. He'll now face a San Francisco defense that allowed 43 scoreboard points in Week 5. That's worth a spot-start in most leagues for those seeking bye-week or injury replacements.","Leading the Browns in targets for the first time in his Cleveland career, Hooper's opportunity rates in Week 5 likely prove more impressive than his actual production. With 10.3 air yards per target on 10 looks, Hooper's rich usage was reminiscent of his big role for Atlanta last season. It's difficult to trust that a shift in Hooper's role is underway and more likely this was a one-game surge in attention. The Steelers have allowed the ninth-fewest fantasy points per game to tight ends, adding more risk to Hooper's profile.",null,null,"Jackson was limited in practice headed into Week 5 action and did not suit up against the Steelers. Even if he's able to play this week, there are better options to be found as the Eagles face a staunch Ravens defensive unit."],"8":["McCaffrey was cleared to practice in advance of Thursday night's date with the Falcons. Carolina will assess the health of his ankle before deciding on his playing status. If deemed good to go, McCaffrey should enjoy a triumphant return against a beatable Atlanta defense.","The best receiver in fantasy football was definitely back in action in Week 7, racking up an incredible 196 yards and a pair of scores against a bottom-10 pass defense from Houston. He gets an even better matchup against Minnesota in Week 8 and, while a healthy Aaron Jones could slightly impact his ceiling, that's overthinking it to the highest degree. Adams is arguably the top option in all of fantasy for the week ahead and should start in all leagues.",null,"Kupp was second on the Rams in targets with six on Monday night, but the fact that he trailed Josh Reynolds in that category and not Robert Woods is a bit of a surprise. Woods was dealing with an injury and could have been held back as a result, but it's interesting that Kupp was not the one to see the big boost in volume with his fellow starter ailing. He remains a fairly consistent receiver with decent upside and should be started for this week's game against Miami, but he's no longer the fantasy superstar he's been at times in the past.","Grinding out 102 scrimmage yards on 21 touches last week, Hunt is a certifiable RB1 as he heads into a choice matchup with Las Vegas. The Raiders have allowed 4.87 yards per carry to tailbacks and only the Packers are yielding more fantasy points per game to backfields than Las Vegas. Start and enjoy.","Finally putting together a stretch of strong performances, it appears Green and rookie Joe Burrow are developing some rewarding chemistry of late. Green now sits 10th in the NFL in total targets, so volume is on his side as he heads into a matchup with a Titans secondary generously allowing the fourth-most fantasy points per game to receivers.","Once Mark Ingram II went down early in the team's recent win over Philadelphia, Dobbins commanded a majority share of the third-down snaps, with Gus Edwards dominating early-down usage. This role didn't net Dobbins a big day from scrimmage, and for this upcoming meeting with a stingy Pittsburgh front, he's unlikely to compile many yards once again.","Impressively one yard shy of Melvin Gordon in scrimmage yardage despite handling 10 fewer touches last week, Lindsay left the game early after taking on helmet-to-helmet contact in the second quarter. He still led the team in rushing despite the brief appearance, but with Melvin Gordon taking on more receiving and goal-line work, Lindsay is a risky play this week.","Slayton was a non-factor last Thursday as he was slowed by a sore foot and defended by Darius Slay for most of the evening. The Buccaneers and their formidable secondary visit the Meadowlands on Sunday night.  Slayton's ability to stretch the field will result in some big games, but he's too unreliable to trust for fantasy production.","Gameflow did not favor Gesicki as he didn't catch a single pass in Week 6, as the Dolphins were content to play conservatively in their 24-0 shutout of the Jets. Look for Gesicki to rebound as game script should be in his favor with Tua Tagovailoa now calling the plays for Miami. Consider Gesicki to be in the streaming tier for this week's home affair with the Rams.","Goff had a fairly standard \"Jared Goff game\" in Week 7, scoring a pair of touchdowns with a pedestrian 219 yards and falling just shy of a truly legitimate QB1 performance. However, it is somewhat noteworthy because it came against a very capable Chicago defense, and he'll get a bit of a break in the week ahead against Miami. That said, there are better \"pick up and play\" options at the QB position for Week 8.","Sidelined by an appendectomy last week, it's not clear when Hooper will be ready to get on the field again. If he's cleared for this choice matchup with Las Vegas, he's in a good spot to command a strong target share with Odell Beckham Jr. off the field. A nice matchup and bump in usage spells TE1 territory for Hooper if he's active.",null,"The Seahawks failed to sack Kyler Murray while allowing 37 scoreboard points to the Cardinals in Week 7. The 49ers present a somewhat interesting matchup, but nothing about the Seattle D/ST says they should be in your fantasy lineup for Week 8.",null],"9":["After missing the past six games with a high-ankle sprain, McCaffrey is expected to don the pads for this week's visit to Kansas City. The matchup isn't ideal as Kansas City hasn't yielded a receiving touchdown to a running back all season long. However, they've surrendered the sixth-most rushing yards per game. Regardless, if McCaffrey is active, he needs to be back in your fantasy lineup.","The reception and yardage totals weren't that impressive, but Adams hauled in a trio of TD passes in Week 8 to give him a massive fantasy stat line for the second week in a row. Healthy and back in the lineup since the bye week, Adams has seen double-digit targets in every start and will be even more important in Week 9 against an elite run defense from San Francisco. Look for Adams to be on the receiving end of plenty of Aaron Rodgers' passes, making him one of the top options in all of fantasy this week.","Exiting the bye on a fun fantasy streak of four straight games with at least 300 yards and multiple passing scores, a franchise record, Watson is set up to deliver another big line facing a Jacksonville defense that rates last in the league in pressuring quarterbacks.",null,null,null,"It was encouraging for Dobbins' potential to see him more than double Gus Edwards in offensive snaps on the way to a career-high 113 rushing yards, which is both the most for a Ravens back this season and the most against the Steelers in a game this year. The Ravens still don't rely on their backs as receivers very often, making this matchup against the Colts particularly unfavorable for this rookie given that Indianapolis has allowed the fewest yards per game to backs among AFC defenses this season.","Lindsay has impressively averaged 10.3 yards per touch the past two weeks. When compared to Melvin Gordon's 3.8, you'd think this change-of-pace threat would earn a more significant role. For now, the pattern appears to suggest Lindsay will handle around eight to 10 touches in this complementary role aside Gordon. Atlanta has been soft against the pass but claim solid rush defense metrics, adding risk to Lindsay's profile.","Slayton's five catches for 52 yards could have been better had Daniel Jones been able to connect with him on a few downfield routes when Slayton gained separation. That said, it's encouraging that the sophomore duo continue to take shots at big plays while the Giants also use Slayton on shorter routes. Consider Slayton as a flex play with upside as the Giants head to Washington for a Week 9 encounter.","Only on the field in clear passing scenarios, Gesicki loses out on a good deal of snaps and routes given such a limited role. Losing steam as a receiving threat in this offense since Ryan Fitzpatrick was shelved, this â€œmoveâ€ tight end isn't a strong option against a solid tandem of safeties for the Cardinals. ",null,null,null,"One of the weaker D/ST units so far this season, the Seahawks will travel across the country to face the Bills in Week 9. Buffalo has a high-upside offense and Seattle struggles to slow down opponents' scoring, so look elsewhere for your D/ST needs this week.",null],"10":["So much for alternating series with Mike Davis as McCaffrey recorded his usual workload, generating a robust 151 scrimmage yards to go along with a pair of scores, one on the ground and one through the air. Unfortunately, McCaffrey suffered a shoulder injury on the last drive and is questionable heading into Week 10's rematch with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. As always, if McCaffrey is active for Carolina, he's active for you.","Adams delivered a trademark outing against the 49ers in Week 9, racking up 173 yards and scoring a touchdown while logging 12 targets. When healthy this season, Adams has seen double-digit targets and lots of red zone looks. That should continue against one of the weaker pass defenses in the NFL (Jacksonville) in Week 10, when Adams will be a top fantasy wideout in all formats.","We have to travel back to Week 2 to find the last outing Watson delivered fewer than two touchdowns. In fact, he now has three-straight games with at least 250 yards and multiple passing scores without an interception, the longest such streak in Texans history. Relying more on his playmakers with quick passes, more than 70% of Watson's yardage this past week came after the catch, the highest single-game tally of his career. The Browns have some talent in the front seven but have struggled in coverage overall, resulting in passers averaging 20.1 fantasy points per game -- in line with Watson's projection.","Kupp had an incredible 20 passes thrown his way in Week 8 as the Rams attempted to air it out against Miami. This week he'll face a much more favorable defensive matchup, as Seattle allows the most points per game to opposing wideouts. Kupp's volume has been a bit scattered this season, but even a more modest share of the offense should net him plenty of fantasy points in Week 10 against such a porous secondary.","Averaging 79.2 scrimmage yards and 17.2 touches as the lead back for Cleveland since Nick Chubb went down with injury earlier this season, Hunt is the bankable option from this otherwise mediocre Cleveland offense. With Chubb likely back in the fold this week, the matchup still proves appealing for Hunt, as only the Packers and Lions have allowed more fantasy points per game to backs than Houston.","With just three games with more than 10 fantasy points this season in ESPN PPR scoring, Green has endured a disappointing first half of the campaign. Then again, he also consumed 29 targets during his past three outings heading into the team's recent bye, suggesting there is some momentum to consider. With the Steelers' defense struggling at times against outside receivers (Pittsburgh has allowed the 12th-most fantasy points per game to receivers), Green enters this rivalry as a risky flex play.","Producing only two first downs on his 12 totes this past weekend, Dobbins did at least come through for a high-leverage fourth down conversion late in the win over the Colts. Still, it's not very fun for fantasy purposes to witness Dobbins lose out on valuable goal-to-go work to veteran Gus Edwards, but such is the case in this Baltimore committee.","With just two catches on the entire season, Lindsay continues to serve a somewhat specialized rushing role for Denver. Far more effective and efficient on a per-touch basis that Melvin Gordon thus far, Lindsay's limiting role removes any real potential for fantasy fun from this playmaker's profile. This upcoming matchup with the Raiders' weak rush defense is inviting based on metrics, but Lindsay is unlikely to see the ball enough for it to matter.","With Golden Tate a healthy Week 9 scratch, Slayton had a chance for an increased workload, but it failed to manifest as he caught his only target for just six yards. The primary hindrance is Slayton's strength is as a downfield big-play threat, but the Giants offense isn't currently equipped to take advantage. The Giants face a strong Eagles pass defense in Week 10, rendering Slayton a boom or bust flex for those so inclined.","After a pair of non-productive games, in Week 9 Gesicki demonstrated he and Tua Tagovailoa could be developing a rapport by handling three of four targets for 42 yards. The duo should have a chance to hook up frequently in Week 10 when the Dolphins welcome the Chargers to South Beach. Gesicki checks in as a steaming play against the 11th most generous defense to opposing tight ends.","Goff attempted a season-high 61 passes against Miami in Week 8, but also turned the ball over four times and scored only a single touchdown. It's tempting to move on from him as a fantasy manager, but a matchup with Seattle is appealing for even the most mediocre of passers. The Seahawks are allowing four fantasy points more per game than the 30th-ranked pass defense and lead the league, by a wide margin, in yards per game conceded. Based on matchup alone, Goff is a low-end starting option in fantasy leagues of all sizes.","A surgery kept Hooper off the field for a few weeks, but he's expected to return to action this week for Cleveland. Potentially the second target in the passing phase behind Jarvis Landry going forward, Hooper makes for a savvy plug-and-play against a Houston back seven allowing 14.5 fantasy points per game to tight ends.",null,"The Seattle defense racked up an incredible seven sacks in Week 9, but that only served to offset the 44 scoreboard points allowed. This unit has struggled to stop the pass all season and that pass-rushing outburst seems like an outlier.

Otherwise, look elsewhere for your Week 10 D/ST.",null],"11":["McCaffrey missed Week 10 with a sore shouder. He has been ruled out for Week 11's favorable matchup with the Lions. ","Adams found the end zone for the fourth straight game in the Packers' Week 10 win over the Jaguars, catching eight passes for 66 yards (including that six-yard scoring strike). Next up is a Colts defense allowing the sixth-fewest WR fantasy points per game. Even so, Adams remains one of the top overall fantasy players and is always a \"must start.\"","Watson wasn't effective in the strong wind in Cleveland last week and particularly struggled when the Browns sent added pressure, as he completed just 45.5% of his passes when facing additional pass rushers in Week 10. The Patriots don't rely on the blitz to get to the pocket and New England's front seven could struggle to contain Watson's speed as a runner, setting him up as a solid starting option for this AFC matchup.","Kupp entered Week 10 as one of the best plays on the board against Seattle's porous pass defense. While five receptions for 50 yards isn't terrible, more was expected. Kupp looks to get back on track, possibly returning to a low-end WR1 level, in Week 11's Monday night showcase against Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers defense is allowing nearly a touchdown per game to opposing wideouts.","Nick Chubb and Hunt reached 100 yards on the ground in the same game for the first time in what was Hunt's first triple-digit rushing performance with Cleveland. The heavy rushing workload for this tandem was a bit of an outlier this past week due to such high winds in Cleveland. Then again, this backfield is the most projectable and productive element of the Browns' offense, with Hunt's workload in the passing game helping support flex value even as the Eagles have been strong against the run.","Without a single reception for the second time in the past five outings, Green once again struggled to connect with Joe Burrow down the field. For the game, Burrow completed just two passes thrown at least 10 yards, so it wasn't just Green that couldn't gain traction against Pittsburgh. With the Washington defense ceding the third-fewest fantasy points per game to receivers on the year, Green enters the game as a weak fantasy play.","Seemingly in the weakest position among the team's trio of tailbacks when considering recent usage patterns, fantasy managers simply shouldn't deploy the rookie in lineups given an expectation for just a handful of touches against Tennessee this weekend.","Despite often finishing as the team's most productive per-touch tailback, Lindsay was fed only four touches this past week and simply couldn't surface as a helpful fantasy contributor. With the Miami defense proving somewhat respectable against the run and Lindsay so often forgotten in this offense, it's best to leave him on the pine.",null,"It's nice to see Gesicki net big gains per catch in recent outings, but less encouraging to consider he's only seeing a handful of targets each week. With the Broncos proving solid in coverage against tight ends this season, it's safe to fade this Penn State product.","In Week 10, Goff failed to thrown a touchdown for the first time since opening week, but he did clear the 300-yard plateau for the second straight game (and fourth time this season), engineering a 23-16 victory over Seattle. Next on the docket is a matchup with Tom Brady and the Buccaneers on Monday night. Definitely consider Goff if you need a bye-week replacement or an injury fill-in at quarterback.","This past week was so windy in Cleveland that Hooper simply wasn't used much as a receiving threat. That could change this week with a matchup against a Philadelphia secondary struggling to contain in the second level of late. There is some risk in investing in the Cleveland passing game, but Hooper is likely second in line for meaningful targets against a Philadelphia defense allowing the fourth-most fantasy points per game to the position.",null,"The Seahawks defense continues to give up yards by the bushel, though their sacks and turnover numbers are both at a top-10 level.

Obviously, if Carolina trusts McCaffrey, so should you.","Since returning from injury in Week 6, Adams has scored 11 touchdowns over eight games, with 100-plus  yards in four of those contests. He's truly one of the best players in all of fantasy football and should remain locked into your lineups against a lackluster Detroit defense.","Despite the constant pressure from the Colts' pass rush this past Sunday, Watson was still able to make plays to keep the Texans in the game; he completed all but one of eight attempts outside the pocket for 159 yards, the second-most passing yards outside the pocket for any QB in the last five seasons. Next week includes another tough matchup for Watson, but his awesome playmaking despite a series of roster challenges keeps him firmly in the QB1 tier.","For fantasy purposes, Kupp is the No. 2 receiver in Los Angeles these days, as Robert Woods is getting more volume and has posted  bigger numbers over the last month. But, as has been the case for a while now, when healthy, both players are solid starting options in fantasy leagues of all sizes given the top-heavy nature of the Los Angeles passing game. New England boasts a solid secondary, but that's not enough to move Kupp out of the WR2 spot in nearly every format.","While he saw some high-value touches in the red zone, Hunt ended up with a quiet outing amid the Browns' offensive explosion against Tennessee. With Nick Chubb proving prolific on the ground again, Hunt enters this challenging matchup with Baltimore as a flex play.","Targeted just once on 30 routes in an ugly offensive showing for the Bengals in Miami this past Sunday, Green simply can't be trusted in lineups in the middle of the fantasy playoffs. Dallas is one of the better matchups for receivers on the season, but Green is unlikely to capitalize. ","His fans on Twitter rightfully demand more work for Dobbins, as the rookie often appears to be the best back for the Ravens when given touches. Compiling 71 scrimmage yards and a touchdown last week bolsters Dobbins' case as a low-end flex play this week against a respectable Browns front.","Averaging just 1.8 yards per carry in a game that saw peer Melvin Gordon top eight yards per touch isn't ideal for Lindsay's value going forward. We can expect Lindsay to see his share of touches this week in Carolina, but even this inviting matchup doesn't add much fantasy value for a back limited to breaking big plays between the 20s.","The prototypical \"boom or bust\" play registered his third dud in his past four games in Week 13, catching just one pass for 14 yards. To be fair, with Colt McCoy filling in for Daniel Jones, the Giants rarely threw downfield, limiting Slayton's opportunities. The club is hopeful that Jones will be back for their Week 14 home tilt with the Cardinals. Even if that's the case, Slayton remains too risky to trust on a fantasy roster.","This Penn State product produced his second-best fantasy performance of the season in a win over the Bengals this past Sunday; one that tied his season-high with 11 targets and included plenty of attention around the goal line. The Chiefs have allowed 13 fantasy points per game to tight ends on the year, setting up Gesicki as a worthy streaming option for managers.","Goff has delivered a pair of QB1-worthy performances in his last three outings, but they were both against bottom-half pass defenses (Tampa Bay and Arizona). His next matchup is against a very good New England secondary, and should be avoided for fantasy purposes.

Now up to a career-high 27 passing scores this season, Watson is poised for a strong finish to the season with this inviting matchup with the Bengals up next.","Kupp had just five passes thrown his way in Week 15 for the third time in four games. The once reliable volume receiver has taken a big step back this season and is no longer a top option for fantasy managers. Instead, his upside relies on the matchup. Thankfully, there's no better matchup for wideouts than one with Seattle. Kupp is worth a start as a WR3/flex against a team which has allowed tons of points to opposing receivers this season.","A week removed from a magical multi-touchdown performance, Hunt was held scoreless and limited to just 28 scrimmage yards against the Giants in Week 15. If you survived such a sluggish showing from Hunt, there is some potential for a bounce-back showing from this flex candidate against a Jets defense that ranks right around league average against backfields.","Accounting for nearly half of the team's receiving yards this past week sounds impressive until you notice Green netted just 40 yards on two catches. There is hope for a better week with the Texans allowing the 10th-most fantasy points to receivers, but Green really shouldn't be trusted at this stage of the season.","The true breakout hasn't really surfaced yet for Dobbins, as Gus Edwards and Lamar Jackson remain such effective competition for high-value rushing work in Baltimore. It was nice to see Dobbins score yet another touchdown this past week, which he'll likely need to repeat to help fantasy managers in a tougher matchup with a solid Giants rush defense.","In what has been a somewhat consistent pattern, Lindsay nearly evenly split rushing duties with backfield peer Melvin Gordon this past week, but ceded the high-leverage red zone work to Gordon. Without any real value in the passing game, Lindsay isn't worth trusting in the thick of the fantasy playoffs against the Chargers.","Slayton was fill-in signal-caller Colt McCoy's favorite target in Week 15, getting nine looks. He converted that attention into four receptions and 74 yards. Considering Slayton notched just four catches total in the previous three contests, he's not trustworthy enough to insert into any Week 16 lineups when the Giants head to Baltimore.","A shoulder injury kept this Penn State product from seeing the field this past week, but he was on quite a touchdown tear before getting injured. If he's active this week, it's worth streaming Gesicki given he has four touchdowns in his past three games and faces a porous pass defense.","Goff followed up one of his best performances of the season (against Tampa Bay in Week 11) with only four touchdowns and four interceptions over the next four games -- with three of those games finishing at under 210 yards passing. He has chipped in a pair of rushing touchdowns over that span to bolster his numbers a bit, but that's not a part of his game on which you can rely.

The Packers have allowed just 17.4 fantasy points per game to passers, while Watson's unique dual-threat ability supports QB1 expectations.","The good news is that Kupp had nine passes thrown his way in Week 6, his second-highest total this season. The bad news is that Kupp caught only three of them for a sad 11 yards. While a lot of that can be blamed on a tough defensive matchup against the 49ers, things get no easier this week against the Bears. Chicago is allowing the third-fewest WR fantasy points this season, so downgrade Kupp to more of a WR3/flex play in most leagues.","A forgettable Week 6 saw Hunt average only 3.1 yards per rush in a tough matchup. The positive angle is Hunt was clearly leading the backfield in snaps and touches before the game got out of hand. With what should be a more competitive climate against Cincinnati, a defense allowing 24.5 fantasy points per game to backfields, Hunt makes for an elite starter at his position.","Joe Burrow and Green finally found a productive rhythm in Week 6, with the rookie passer finding Green for a season-high 96 yards. Green's strong catch rate is most encouraging given how inefficient this connection was in earlier weeks. With Cleveland allowing 194 yards per game to receivers, fifth most in the league, Green is at least a streaming candidate for this division matchup.",null,"With Melvin Gordon sidelined last week, Lindsay served as the early-down hammer for the Broncos on his way to a solid showing from scrimmage. A real lack of work on passing snaps limited the fantasy fun, and now the return of Gordon removes any real fantasy appeal from Lindsay's profile for this meeting with the Chiefs.","Slayton played through a sore foot in Week 6 to capture two passes for 41 yards and a touchdown against Washington. It was his lowest catch total and second-lowest receiving yards on the season. With a brief turnaround before New York's Thursday night affair in Philadelphia, Slayton still may not be at 100%. Nevertheless, he's worth consideration as a flex option if you're shorthanded.",null,"Goff faces the toughest QB matchup in all of fantasy football this week, as the Bears are allowing the fewest QB fantasy points per game in 2020. Given his already low upside (under 200 yards in two of his last three games), it's best to start looking elsewhere for your fantasy QB1 needs for Week 7.","It was good for his overall fantasy stock to see Hooper leading the Browns in targets for a second straight week.  However, he will miss Week 7 and perhaps Week 8 as well after requiring surgery for appendicitis.",null,"The Seattle defense has allowed 23-plus scoreboard points in every week this season, while racking up only nine sacks in five games. There's not enough upside here to overcome the challenging matchup against the Cardinals in Week 7. As such, the Seahawks D/ST is not a recommended starting unit.","Jackson hopes to return to practice this week with the intent of suiting up Thursday when the Eagles entertain the Giants. Even if Jackson takes the field, he won't be a solid fantasy option until he establishes that he's fully healthy and back in sync with Carson Wentz."],"12":[null,"Adams is one of the best receivers in the NFL and proves that on a weekly basis with incredible stat lines when healthy. Even against a very strong Indianapolis defense in Week 11, he went over 100 yards and found the end zone. The Bears are great against the pass, but nothing should stop you from putting a healthy Adams in your starting lineup.","The loss of Texans legend DeAndre Hopkins remains undoubtedly significant, but it's conversely impressive that Watson already has five games with at least 300 passing yards this season, tied for his most in a season. Fresh from his best fantasy line of the season against a respectable New England pass defense, Watson next faces a Detroit defense that has the league's lowest pressure rate on opposing passers.","Kupp had another vintage performance in Week 11, handling 13 targets and grabbing 11 of them for 145 yards. That's the sort of production we remember from Kupp's 2019 breakout, but it has become more of an occasional occurrence in 2020. Still, it's worth noting that his volume seemed to increase in a matchup with a strong run defense, which is also the case in Week 12 against the 49ers. As such, there's reason for optimism that Kupp will deliver another WR1-level performance, making him an easy choice to start in all leagues.","A touchdown salvaged an otherwise ineffective showing from Hunt against the Eagles this past week; he averaged just 1.5 yards per touch while backfield peer Nick Chubb was much more efficient. With the Jaguars yielding the sixth-most fantasy points per game to backfields, there is great potential for a stronger showing from scrimmage from Hunt this weekend.","It's telling that 41 yards and a score this past weekend against the Colts marks Green's third-highest fantasy tally of the season. While it was nice that Green entered the end zone for the first time this season, his statistical prospects going forward appear quite compromised given a somewhat massive downgrade behind center due to Joe Burrow's injury. The Giants have struggled in coverage on the outside at times this season, but Green is unlikely to take advantage of the matchup.","Did the Ravens just make a meaningful shift in the backfield? It's quite possible, as Dobbins emerged from the three-headed Baltimore backfield this past Sunday to handle 17 touches, while no other back topped three touches in the loss to Tennessee. had 15 carries while the rest of the Ravensâ€™ running backs had five. An elusive back in that he can extend plays past contact, Dobbins tallied roughly half of his rushing yardage after initial contact this past Sunday. Unfortunately, Dobbins has been placed on the reserve list due to a positive COVID-19 result, likely sidelining the Ohio State product for this key rivalry. ","Leading his team with 16 touches this past week, Lindsay continues to prove productive from scrimmage, but touchdown success still eludes him given how often backfield peer Melvin Gordon nets high-value red zone work. It's quite the risk to deploy Lindsay in lineups this week given how well the Saints have stifled fantasy production from enemy backfields.","When the Giants last suited up, Slayton shook off a poor Week 9 effort with a solid performance in Week 10, showing off his downfield abilities with five catches for 93 yards. The sophomore wideout has a chance to put his big-play capability to use as the Giants emerge from the Week 11 bye with a visit to a hobbled Cincinnati team. The Bengals secondary can be beaten over the top, rendering Stayton as a Week 12 upside flex play.","It appears Gesicki has established a pattern; he's produced between 40 and 43 yards in each of the past three games. Held without a catch in his last meeting with the Jets earlier this season, you will likely want to research stronger streaming options than this Penn State product.","With every team in action in Week 12, most fantasy managers don't need to search the waiver wire for a starting quarterback. That means Goff, coming off of a solid outing against the Buccaneers, doesn't need to factor into your plans. After all, he's facing a San Francisco defense which he struggled against just a few weeks ago, and he's had a very inconsistent season with very few QB1-worthy performances.","A disappointing debut season in Cleveland has Hooper pacing for just shy of 400 yards. This past week, \"Hoop\" was held to only three catches, but a stronger showing could emerge facing a Jaguars pass defense that has allowed the sixth-most fantasy points per game to tight ends.",null,"The Eagles have struggled mightily in recent weeks to take care of the football, and the Seattle D/ST is in prime position to capitalize. This unit allows tons of yardage but is capable of getting to the quarterback and forcing turnovers. Consider them to be a solid \"pick up and play\" option for Week 12.",null],"13":[null,"The Packers didn't need to pass the ball all that often iin order to put away the Bears in Week 12, but Adams did find the end zone before the game got too out of hand. That extending his scoring streak to six games and  he'll look to make it seven against the Eagles, a team that's solid against the pass but not too imposing of a matchup. Consider him a top-end WR1 in all leagues in Week 13.","Now up to 95 passing scores in 49 career games, only Dan Marino (114), Patrick Mahomes (103 in 41 games) and Kurt Warner (101) have more in their first 50 career games. One of the league's best passers from the pocket and also a dynamic runner, Watson is the rare signal-callers worthy of trusting against the Colts' stingy pass defense.","Like most of the Rams offense, Kupp was kept quiet in Week 12, limited to only a pair of receptions on five targets. However, he did have the fewest targets of the team's top-three wideouts, which is an all-too-familiar concern for those who roster the Eastern Washington product. We've previously seen him rebound from low-volume weeks to get double-digit looks and post huge numbers, though, and there's no reason to suspect he won't do that again in a matchup with a lackluster Arizona defense.","Leading the league since 2018 with 2.46 yards after contact per rush, Hunt is the rare complementary back who merits trust in all formats. The Titans have allowed the seventh-most fantasy points per game to backfields, setting up Hunt as a solid flex.","Without a catch for the second time this season, Green's demise has been both with his own play and the poor production behind center. With a backup quarterback leading the offense, Green isnâ€™t worth playing in this otherwise nice matchup with the Dolphins.","Just as this gifted rookie out of Ohio State was starting to make a major impression for the Baltimore offense, he was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list, thus missing Week 12's matchup with Pittsburgh. If he's cleared for this inviting matchup with a Dallas defense allowing roughly 25 fantasy points per game to backfields, then Dobbins could deliver value as a strong flex play.","Opening the game as the team's Wildcat quarterback, Lindsay served multiple roles in gaining 20 yards on nine touches before leaving the field for good with a knee injury before the half. Reports suggest the injury isn't significant, but it's unlikely you can trust a player who rarely sees the ball in the passing phase in a tougher matchup with the Chiefs. ","Slayton is the very definition of a \"boom or bust\" play. Week 12 was the ultimate bust as the sophomore wideout had zero catches on just two targets. The Giants next head across the country to take on the Seahawks in Week 13. On paper, this is a juicy matchup, but Slayton is too risky to trust unless you need to gamble on \"lightning in a bottle\" from your flex spot.","The Penn State product wasn't very efficient this past Sunday in that he hauled in just two of his five targets, but at least one of them went for a touchdown. There is clearly risk in streaming Gesicki in lineups this week given his low target rate, but it's undeniably a great matchup against a Bengals back seven allowing more than 15 fantasy points per game.","In Week 12, Goff threw a pair of picks for the third time in four games. With four lost fumbles over that same span, it's safe to say the Los Angeles quarterback has been having a \"turnover issue\" of late. That's not great news for a passer already lacking in yardage and scoring upside most weeks. Even against a weaker Arizona defense, it's hard to recommend Goff in any fantasy format.","A nine-yard score salvaged yet another sluggish yardage showing from Hooper, who has rarely connected with Baker Mayfield this season. Given he's seen just two targets in two of the past three games, even a matchup with a struggling back seven for the Titans isn't enough to make Hooper a viable play. ",null,"The Seahawks were able to pressure and sack Carson Wentz several times on Monday night, which is a good sign for their utility as a fantasy D/ST moving forward. The Giants will likely be starting a backup at quarterback in an already thin offense, so feel free to \"plug and play\" the Seattle D/ST in your Week 13 lineups.",null],"15":[null,"There may not be a better fantasy player than Adams, who has scored a touchdown in eight straight games with five 100-yard performances over that span. Against a Carolina defense which allowed four passing touchdowns to the Broncos a week ago, lock in Adams as your top wideout and trust that yet another big performance is imminent.","Facing relentless pressure from the Bears' aggressive defense this past week, Watson was pressured on 42% of his dropbacks in the loss and has been sacked 11 times in the past two games. Even as Watson has been pressured 36 times over his last two games, his stable rushing floor and ability to create big plays in the passing game keep him in the QB1 mix against a strong Colts defense.","The Rams did not need to take to the air much in Week 14 but, when they did, Kupp was in the mix. He found his way into the end zone to salvage an otherwise poor performance. He and Robert Woods are still the top wideouts for this team and get the bulk of the looks in the passing game, but some weeks those looks are just not as exciting from a fantasy perspective. Keep the faith with a prime matchup against a weak Jets secondary on the way, which could offer some upside for Kupp, Woods and the entire Los Angeles passing game.","A quiet start to Week 14's game against the Ravens turned into a week-winning multiple-score showing for Hunt, who is inarguably the most valuable change-of-pace back in the league in fantasy terms. The Giants have been right around league average in fantasy allowance to backs, with Hunt poised as a solid flex play.","A touchdown this past week now has Green one receiving score shy of tying Chad Johnson (66) for the most in Bengals history. With a stingy Steelers defense up next and Green reliant on touchdowns to deliver helpful fantasy results, however, it's best to fade the franchise legend this week.","A short score and a two-point conversion helped save an otherwise quiet outing for Dobbins, who saw his quarterback and backfield peer combine for four scores in the win over Cleveland. Primed for a big game against a bad rush defense this week, Dobbins makes for a fun flex.","Netting just 2.4 yards per touch against a Carolina defense that couldn't slow down Melvin Gordon for much of the afternoon, Lindsay produced another quiet fantasy outing this past week. Without any real equity in the passing game and a respectable defense on deck, Lindsay should be left on the bench or in free agency.","After amassing just three targets over the previous two games, Slayton led the Giants in Week 14 with eight looks, corralling three balls for 31 yards. While the increased involvement is encouraging, it isn't enough to land him on the Week 15 fantasy radar.","Gesicki was enjoying an awesome game in Week 14 before bowing out with a shoulder injury late in the loss to the Chiefs. It's notable that Gesicki put together his second two-touchdown game of his career before exiting, but the injury could cost him this game against New England.","The Rams are on a roll of late, but that hot streak doesn't exactly translate to using Goff as a fantasy option. Tasked with \"game manager\" duties more often than not, he has just two passing touchdowns over his last three outings. A pair of rushing touchdowns during that span help bolster his totals, but that's not something to rely on from the not-particularly-athletic Goff. Against a porous Jets defense, it's tempting to start Goff if you're looking for a one-week option, but with the Rams performing so well in the running game, it's hard to see much upside here. Look elsewhere for your Week 15 starter.","The team hopes to have Hooper back this week for a tilt with the Giants after missing Week 14 with a neck ailment. Even if he's active, the team simply hasn't made good on their investment in Hooper, leaving him outside of the starting tier of tight ends against a solid pass defense.",null,"If Alex Smith is out for Washington in Week 15, Seattle becomes a must-start D/ST. However, since Smith is likely to suit up, this isn't quite as easy of a decision for fantasy managers. Seattle has feasted upon struggling offenses in recent weeks, but still struggles to force turnovers. This unit is a very risky low-end starting option, given the safety of a matchup against Washington.",null],"17":[null,"Adams made up for a lackluster Week 15 by scoring three times in Week 16's blowout win over the Titans. He's a superstar and a must-play in all formats, even against a much tougher Chicago defense in the 2020 finale.","An elbow injury suffered on a sack by the Bengals last week saw Watson leave the field and head to the medical tent, but the tough signal-caller returned to the field to complete the game. Watson vows to play this final week against the rival Titans and could add to his franchise record 30 passing scores if he's active, but there is also some risk present given the inconsequential nature of this final game for the franchise's undeniable talent.","Kupp's roller-coaster season continued against the Seahawks, as he was back in the mix with nine targets after seeing just 10 combined looks over the previous two games. However, with backup QB John Wolford playing in Week 17, it's hard to expect big yardage totals from any Rams receiver. Now, Kupp himself may not be able to play as he has been placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list. ","A touchdown against the Jets this past week helped make up for a relatively quiet day from scrimmage, as this versatile back was limited to just seven touches in the loss. The Ravens are generally solid against backfields, but Hunt famously delivered two scores in prime-time action against them a few weeks back. There is still some risk present given Baltimore's bigger track record of defensive success, leaving Hunt as a flex option in most formats. ","Only able to net 64 yards in a game that saw his quarterback tally a career-high 371 yards in the air, Green's lackluster season and possibly his Bengals career are coming to a conclusion in next week's difficult matchup with the Ravens. Baltimore, after all, has allowed the 11th-fewest yards to receivers on the season.","The rising rookie now has a rushing score in five straight games, tied for the second-longest such streak in Ravens history. Dobbins' seven rushing scores are the most by a rookie in franchise history, even as he's essentially splitting snaps and touches down the middle with Gus Edwards of late. While he's not working with a heavy workload each week, efficiency and high-value touches around the red zone helps Dobbins' case as a solid fantasy play against a Cincinnati team allowing the second-most yards per carry to backfields.",null,"In part because several of his targets were throwaways, Slayton's catch efficiency entering Week 17 is a poor 51.6%. In Week 16, he caught just 2-of-8 balls for 26 yards. Until the Giants' QB play is more consistent, Slayton remains too unreliable for fantasy deployment.","Playing through a shoulder injury this past week, Gesicki gamely posted more than 50 yards for the third straight game. If he's good to go this week, the Penn State product makes for a solid streamer against the Bills.","Goff has been ruled out for Week 17 after undergoing thumb surgery. John Wolford will start in his place.","A career-high 15 targets this past week didn't net Hooper a huge line against the Jets, as he's really yet to fully build a rapport with Baker Mayfield in his first season in Cleveland. The Ravens have allowed 12.6 fantasy points per game to tight ends, a bit more than league average, but Hooper's lack of chemistry with his quarterback limits the appeal this week.",null,"Seattle's D/ST has been on the rise in recent weeks and, with playoff positioning still on the line in Week 17, they could be in for a big day against the 49ers. San Francisco is dealing with a plethora of injuries on offense and the Seahawks D/ST, with 18 sacks and six takeaways over the last five games, is a solid choice.","After missing seven games, Jackson finally made his presence felt in Week 16 with an 81-yard catch-and-run for a score. As it turned out, that was Jackson's sole look on the day. Jackson's big-play ability could come in handy in Week 17's tilt with Washington, but it's far to risky to trust for fantasy purposes."],"5":[null,null,"\"Bob\" ball has come to its conclusion in Houston, as the team made the first coaching shift of the season. In last week's loss, Watson was still able to compile his eighth game since 2018 with at least two scores on passes throw at least 15 yards down the field, trailing only Russell Wilson during this span. This is a brutal matchup in that the Jaguars have some of the best pass defense metrics in the league through the first month, but Watson's unique big-play ability keeps him in the starting tier.","Kupp led the way for the Rams in the passing game in a fairly pedestrian overall offensive performance against the Giants. He hauled in five of the seven balls thrown his way and scored a touchdown, his second week in a row finding the end zone. His consistent role and volume make him a solid option in fantasy most weeks and, while Washington has been very strong against the pass thus far (second-fewest WR points allowed), Kupp is still a solid WR2 option for Week 5.","An injury to Nick Chubb didn't see Hunt vault into an every-down workhorse role against Dallas. Rather, he continued his productive change-of-pace role. Chubb's absence did lead to more red zone attention for Hunt, so his touchdown potential is on the rise in the weeks ahead. Even as the Colts have allowed the fourth-fewest fantasy points and sixth-fewest yards to backs, Hunt's unique dual-threat ability supports RB1 value. ","Another inefficient outing has Green with a glaringly low 41.2% catch rate for the season. Converting 34 targets into just 119 yards is almost difficult to do. The hope is that Green begins to connect with Joe Burrow in a key division meeting with Baltimore. It doesn't help, however, that the Ravens are solid against outside receivers such as Green.","Second among Baltimore's backs with 21 snaps last week, but last in backfield in touches and scrimmage yards, Dobbins is truly limited by the team's committee approach to backfield usage. The Bengals aren't a fearsome rush defense and yet Dobbins likely won't get the ball enough to become a factor.","The game between the Patriots and the Broncos has been postponed. Both teams will be on a bye for Week 5.","Slayton's seven targets paced all Giants wideouts, but he was only able to secure three balls for 48 yards as Daniel Jones was hurried all game. Week 5 lines up in Slayton's favor, as the Giants are facing a Cowboys secondary giving up a league-high nine touchdowns to wide receivers. After three games where Slayton averaged three catches for 45 yards, elevate Slayton to WR3 status in Week 5.","Held to a single catch for the second straight week, Gesicki hasn't yet become a real fixture in this Miami passing game. Working in his favor is a strong average depth of target down the seam from Ryan Fitzpatrick. Working against Gesicki is fact the 49ers just shut down Zach Ertz and have allowed the fourth-fewest fantasy points to tight ends. Given the matchup and usage issues, Gesicki is in the streaming tier at the position. ","Goff continued his recent trend of efficient but low-impact play under center for the Rams in Week 4, completing a solid 25 of his 32 attempts -- but for only 200 yards and a single score. Even against a porous Washington pass defense, he lacks the ceiling to be a solid starting option in fantasy.","On field for 63 snaps last week, the most among Cleveland's skill players, a touchdown in the win added Hooper's first solid fantasy showing with Cleveland. While some momentum for Hooper would be fun, it's worth noting the Colts have allowed the fewest fantasy points to tight ends by a sizable margin this season.",null,"The Seahawks D/ST couldn't even manage to deliver a great scoring output against Miami in Week 4. That failure is why a contest with Minnesota in Week 5 doesn't look all that attractive anymore. The Vikings are coming off a solid week on offense, so consider looking elsewhere for your D/ST this week.","Jackson was unable to practice all week and was inactive for the Week 4 matchup against San Francisco.

Seriously. McCaffrey was on the field for an astronomical 93% of the offensive snaps, which was just above his 92% mark in 2018. He set a career high with an 80% carry share (17.9 per game) and has now handled 23% of the targets (8.8/G) in three consecutive seasons. McCaffrey paced the position in snaps, touches, yards, touchdowns, OTD, targets, receptions and carries inside the 5. It's possible McCaffrey will play a bit less in new coach Matt Rhule's offense, but the 24-year-old can afford a reduced role and still dominate the position in fantasy. He should be the first player off the board in your draft.","Adams is back as Aaron Rodgers' unquestioned No. 1 target -- a role that has allowed him to post four consecutive seasons as a top-10 WR in fantasy points per game. Adams handled a career-high 31% target share and was fantasy's No. 2-scoring WR during the 12 weeks in which he was active last season. He finished as a top-five WR in 42% of those outings, which trailed only Michael Thomas. The only concern here is durability as Adams has missed at least one regular-season game due to injury in each of the past three seasons, including four 2019 absences. We'll need to dock him slightly for that, but the 27-year-old's massive usage locks him into the top-end WR1 mix.","Watson enters his fourth NFL season fresh off back-to-back fourth-place finishes in fantasy. The 24-year-old has emerged as one of the game's best players, ranking no lower than eighth in completion percentage and 13th in yards per attempt in each of the past two seasons. Watson has yet to clear 26 passing touchdowns in a season, but he makes up a ton of ground with his legs, ranking top-four in rushing attempts, yards and touchdowns in each of the past two seasons. The elephant in the room is the loss of top weapon DeAndre Hopkins, though it's worth noting that Watson has averaged a strong 9.2 YPA to wide receivers other than Hopkins in his career. Watson remains a solid fantasy starter.","Kupp is a very tricky evaluation following a bizarre 2019 campaign that can be split into two distinct parts. During Weeks 1-12, Kupp played on 87% of snaps and handled a 25% target share. With Tyler Higbee taking on a larger role during Weeks 13-17, those rates dropped to 63% and 15%, respectively. Kupp still ended up fourth in fantasy points due to the strong start and an unsustainable level of touchdown production (10 TD, 5.6 OTD), but we can't overlook the Rams' scheme change in December. The departure of Brandin Cooks definitely helps, but Kupp is now safest-viewed as a mid-to-back-end WR2.","Hunt returns to Cleveland, where he'll operate as a change-of-pace rusher and primary receiving back behind Nick Chubb. Hunt was, of course, one of fantasy's top backs prior to off-field issues leading to roughly one year out of the league. He returned in Week 10 last season and played a substantial role from that point on. Hunt was on the field for 60% of the snaps, handling 5.4 carries and 5.5 targets per game. Hunt was fantasy's No. 17 RB during the stretch and trailed Chubb by only three fantasy points during that span. Chubb will continue to handle most of the carries and goal-line work, but Hunt's role allows him standalone value, not to mention that he's arguably the most valuable insurance policy in fantasy.","Green is back in Cincinnati after missing the entire 2019 season due to injury. Green will enter his age-32 season having missed at least six regular-season games in three of the past four seasons. Despite the durability woes, he has remained a fantasy force, ranking no worse than 16th in fantasy points per game in each of his eight NFL seasons. When we last saw him healthy, Green was fantasy's No. 7-scoring WR through Week 8 of the 2018 season. Green is obviously a risky investment, especially with a rookie quarterback in Joe Burrow, but the superstar receiver can be considered as a WR3 target with obvious upside.","Baltimore grabbed its lead running back of the future by selecting Dobbins with a second-round pick in April's draft. Dobbins is an outstanding athlete with terrific speed, balance and playmaking ability. He sports a 5-foot-9, 209-pound frame and is a three-down option with the ability to contribute as an impact rusher and receiver. In his final season at Ohio State, Dobbins' 2,003 rushing yards and 21 touchdowns tied for tops in this year's rookie class. His 3.5 YAC was sixth. Landing in Baltimore's high-scoring offense sets up Dobbins with a massive long-term ceiling, but he's likely to be utilized as a change-of-pace back in the short term, with Mark Ingram, Gus Edwards and second-year Justice Hill also on the roster. Dobbins won't have much early-season fantasy value but will be a strong end-of-bench stash during the 2020 season.","Lindsay is back in Denver for his third NFL season, but the team's former lead back now figures to settle in as an oft-used change-of-pace runner behind newcomer Melvin Gordon. It's not often you get immediate production from an undrafted player, but Lindsay has produced a pair of 1,000-yard rushing seasons since Denver signed him after the 2018 draft. Lindsay has certainly flashed as a rusher (4.9 career YPC), but he has struggled to produce after contact (1.6 YAC) and as a receiver (4.5 YPT), which explains the team's interest in Gordon. Lindsay's reduced role means he likely won't post his third consecutive top-20 fantasy season, but the 26-year-old is on the flex radar, especially in non-PPR leagues.","In a performance that was eerily similar (albeit not quite as dominant) to the one of the man he helped replace (Odell Beckham Jr.), Slayton missed the first two games of his rookie season before bursting onto the fantasy scene with eight touchdowns in 14 games. Slayton was on the field for 77% of the Giants' pass plays and was WR27 in fantasy points from Week 3 on. Slayton's touchdown rate is far from sustainable (3.5 OTD), but the 2019 fifth-round pick will enter his second season as New York's primary vertical threat. The New York offense has a lot of mouths to feed, but there's certainly a window for Slayton to become the team's No. 1 wideout. Slayton is safest as a flex in deeper leagues.","It was a rough 2019 season for the Dolphins, but that didn't stop Gesicki from quietly taking a big leap forward. The 2018 second-round pick finished the season third among tight ends in pass routes and ranked no lower than 12th in targets, receptions, receiving yards or touchdowns. Gesicki's 11 end zone targets tied for most among tight ends and eighth in the entire league. His 58% catch rate was ugly, but his role as a seam-stretcher (10.1 aDOT) and shaky quarterback accuracy (22% off target rate) were the primary culprits. Gesicki has yet to drop a pass on 120 targets and was fantasy's TE12 in 2019. He's a candidate for another leap forward and a borderline TE1 option.","The Rams' offense took a step back last season, but heavy volume allowed Goff to make occasional noise in fantasy. Goff finished top-five in pass attempts, completions and yards, which helped him to seven top-10 fantasy weeks (fifth most). The 2016 first overall pick has finished 12th, seventh and 13th in fantasy points during Sean McVay's three seasons. He adds very little with his legs (40 rushing yards last season) but still manages to hang in as a streaming option thanks to McVay. In 2020, Goff will have a strong group of targets led by Robert Woods, Tyler Higbee and Cooper Kupp, though the Rams' line remains a concern. Consider Goff a midrange QB2.","Hooper signed with the Browns during the offseason following four seasons with the Falcons. The 2016 third-round pick has finished no lower than seventh among tight ends in routes, targets, receptions or receiving yards each of the past two seasons. He posted career-high marks in targets (96), receptions (75), receiving yards (787) and touchdowns (six) last season despite missing three games and was fantasy's top-scoring tight end prior to suffering an injury in Week 10. Hooper's stock takes hit as he trades Matt Ryan and Atlanta's pass-heavy offense for Baker Mayfield and a Browns offense that also include David Njoku. Hooper enters his age-25 season as a borderline top-10 fantasy option.","John Christian Ka'iminoeauloameka'ikeokekumupa'a \"Ka'imi\" Fairbairn is the latest in a long list of examples of why you should never reach for a kicker in fantasy. The 26-year-old was the top-scoring kicker in 2018, but he crashed back to earth with a 19th-place finish in 2019. Fairbairn's fall was pretty dramatic, as his accuracy plummeted from 88.1% in 2018 to 80.0% in 2019 on field goals and 95.1% in 2018 to 88.9% in 2019 on extra points. Houston also fell from second to 29th in field goal attempts. Houston clearly isn't worried after signing Fairbairn to a four-year extension during the offseason. Fairbairn is a fine pick in the final round of your draft.","The Seahawks' D/ST has been trending down in recent seasons, and the unit's 17th-place 2019 campaign marked its worst finish since 2010. Seattle ranked third in the league with 32 forced turnovers last season, but allowed the seventh-most yards, 19th-most points and finished 29th in sacks. Jadeveon Clowney, Quinton Jefferson and Mychal Kendricks lead the team's list of key offseason losses, though the additions of first-round-pick Jordyn Brooks, Quinton Dunbar and Bruce Irvin to a core that includes Bobby Wagner, K.J. Wright, Shaquill Griffin and Jarran Reed removes some of the sting. This has the look of a midrange fantasy D/ST.","The Eagles reacquired Jackson last offseason in the hope that he would add a vertical element to their offense. Things looked good early on, with Jackson exploding for an 8-154-2 receiving line in Week 1, but it was all downhill from there. Jackson managed only one target the rest of the season due to injury. The Eagles will give it another go with Jackson in 2020, but he's now 33 and hasn't played a full season since 2013.

splitting a pair of games with the rival Browns last season, Jackson impressively compiled six touchdowns in the air while rushing for 166 on the ground. Jackson will be on the move often against one of the leagueâ€™s better pass rushes, a style the dual-threat superstar is well prepared to handle.","Drake emerged as the lead back for the Cardinals late last season and never looked back. He enters 2020 as one of the better options at the RB position given his high volume and pass-catching ability. The 49ers have a formidable run defense, allowing the second-fewest RB points a year ago, but don't let that slow you down. Drake is a must-start until his role drastically changes.","When healthy, Robinson has been among the best wideouts in the NFL over the past several seasons. However, he's been held back by subpar supporting casts for most of that time, limiting him from being a true superstar. Plus, of course, injuries have slowed him down at times, too. All that said, he logged 16 games in 2019 and scored the eighth-most WR fantasy points, so he's a must-start no matter the matchup.","A controversial deal (at least among Houston fans) saw Johnson come over from Arizona this past offseason. Johnson should serve a busy role for the Texans out of the backfield, aiding his fantasy value in a matchup with a Chiefs defense that allowed the second-most fantasy points to backfields last season.","Leaving the Chargers for division rivals in Denver has Gordon positioned to consume a similar workload to what Los Angeles afforded him in 2019. The Titans were one of just 10 teams to allowed as few as 4.0 yards per carry to tailbacks last season, while Gordon's blend of goal-line and receiving upside helps him sustain RB2 value heading into his Denver debut.","McLaurin was a bright spot on an otherwise disappointing offense for Washington in 2019, as his rapport with Dwayne Haskins Jr. was evident. Heading into 2020, he's the team's best player on offense and a start-worthy fantasy option at wide receiver in most weeks. That's especially true against the Eagles, who allowed the fourth-most WR fantasy points last season.","Engram was well on his way to a breakout campaign in 2019 when an injury sent him to the sidelines. He was on pace for 80 receptions and nearly 1,000 yards receiving with six touchdowns in a full season. A healthy Engram can be expected to press toward those totals as a ceiling in 2020. That journey begins in Week 1 against the Steelers. Consider Engram to be a set-and-forget TE option.","Limited to just 28 receiving yards across two matchups with the Browns last season, the hope is the speedy Brown can get past Clevelandâ€™s secondary a few times in the opener. Given some depth issues at safety and difficulties defending receivers after the catch last season for Cleveland, Brown is poised as a solid flex option to start the season.","The Bears started strong as a D/ST unit last season but quickly fell off. They could well repeat that trend with a Week 1 contest against a pedestrian Detroit offense. Chicago allowed only 33 total scoreboard points to the Lions in their two matchups last season, so the floor should be somewhat high here for fantasy success.","A strong rookie showing proves even more impressive in the context of the Steelers' carousel of quarterbacks last season. Johnson is a fun flex option heading into the opener given the Giants allowed the third-most yards to receivers last season.","Yet to be given a full workload in his time with the Texans, we can expect Johnson to serve a change-of-pace role for Houston complementing David Johnson. While not really in the flex tier at the position, it does help Johnson's case this week that the Chiefs were 31st in defending backfields in regards to fantasy production last season.","A big-play producer at Bama, Ruggs will be tasked with stretching the field for the Raiders right away. This initial matchup is pretty fun with the Panthers allowing the fifth-most fantasy points to receivers last season, but there is also obvious risk in trusting a rookie vertical threat in lineups.",null,null,"Cousins has posted impressive completion rates since joining the Vikings (including a career-high 70% in 2018, followed by last year's 69%), but his numbers don't quite translate into fantasy success. He finished just 15th in QB scoring last year, despite playing in 15 games, and his scoring average falls short of the top-tier options you want to build your fantasy team around. He's a name to consider in the right matchups, but unfortunately, the Packers' solid pass defense (sixth-fewest QB fantasy points allowed last year) isn't the place to start."],"2":["All he did to follow up his MVP campaign is deliver his ninth career game with at least three passing scores. Even as the Baltimore backfield struggled to gain ground, Jackson averaged 6.4 yards per rush in Week 1's drubbing of Cleveland. A meeting with the Texans is up next, a defense with the third-lowest pressure rate last week, aiding Jackson's upside inside and out of the pocket this week.","Drake did not see a lot of work in the passing game with DeAndre Hopkins dominating the targets among pass-catchers, but he did get a healthy 16 carries and scored a touchdown against a sturdy San Francisco defense. This week, he'll take on a Washington team that allowed the third-most RB points last season, so there is no reason to take Drake out of your lineup heading into Week 2.","Robinson was the only Chicago receiver to see consistent playing time in Week 1, and that's to be expected of the team's elite wideout. He didn't post eye-catching numbers, but he did enough -- and saw enough volume -- for you to confidently keep him in your lineup moving forward. That's especially true against a lackluster Giants pass defense.","A stellar Houston debut for Johnson included 109 scrimmage yards and a score. The potential absence of Duke Johnson this week to injury could spell another busy day out of the backfield for this vet. The Ravens are a solid defense against backs, but sheer opportunity rate supports RB2 expectations for Johnson.","An injury to Phillip Lindsay aided Gordon's busy stat line in Week 1, but it was admittedly a nearly even split while Lindsay was active. The Steelers stuffed the Giants running game in Week 1, thus Gordon is a somewhat risky flex candidate for Week 2.","McLaurin has the talent to be a top fantasy option, but is currently hindered a bit because fellow sophomore Dwayne Hoskins is still honing his QB skills. Still, McLaurin led Washington receivers with 61 yards on five grabs, despite drawing the coverage of top cornerback Darius Slay, who had been acquired by the Eagles specifically to shut down opposing No. 1 wideouts. Week 2 should be easier sledding for McLaurin as the Cardinals donâ€™t have anyone of Slayâ€™s ilk. Consider McLaurin to be a solid fantasy WR2.","A solid Steelers defense, along with a couple of early missed chances, resulted in a disappointing Week 1 effort from Engram, who was routinely drafted as one of the leagueâ€™s better tight ends. Week 2 should be easier sledding, though, as the Giants travel to the Windy City to play Chicago's not-as-stout defense. Donâ€™t be discouraged. Engram will eventually rebound, and likely this week.","With an awesome 21 air yards per target against the Browns, Brown opened the campaign with a 100-yard effort  Against the Browns, Jackson targeted open receivers 64% of the time, which is his highest percentage in a single game in his career.","The Bears could not manage to make an impact on the fantasy scoreboard as a D/ST in Week 1, and we should expect more of the same moving forward. There simply is not enough consistency in this team's pass rush or in takeaways to merit a spot in your fantasy lineup, not even against an up-and-down Giants offense.","A rough first half in Week 1 saw Johnson bounce back after the break to catch five of 10 second-half targets against the Giants. While JuJu Smith-Schuster was the main weapon in the red zone, Johnson's busy role as a primary read in the offense was a good sign for his value against the Broncos this week.","An ankle injury limited Johnson in Week 1 and has kept him from practice early in the week, signaling real risk that he won't be either available or at his best for this difficult matchup with the Ravens.","The Raiders at least are deploying the rookie speedster right away as a vertical weapon; Ruggs averaged a team-high 19 air yards per target and 18.3 yards per catch in his first game. The Saints have struggled against receivers in regards to fantasy points allowed dating back to Week 10 of last season, setting up Ruggs as a volatile flex.",null,null,"The Vikings were on the back foot on offense in Week 1, getting outplayed by the Packers in a high-scoring contest that left Minnesota chasing the game. Cousins performed well enough, focusing mostly on his favored receiver Adam Thielen, but his overall performance left a lot to be desired. He's not a starting option for Week 2 against the Colts, even if they did look a little bit vulnerable in Week 1 against the Jaguars."],"3":["For how much magic Jackson can create outside of the pocket, it's impressive to note he did most of his damage from within the pocket in Week 2, going 16-of-19 for 172 yards and a score on those attempts. Set for a high-scoring duel with the Chiefs this week, Jackson once against claims on of the highest projections of the slate.","Drake received a healthy 20 carries against Washington in Week 8 and provided a respectable 86 yards on the ground, but his lack of contributions in the passing game so far this season are certainly suboptimal for those banking on him as an every-week back. With only four targets and 14 receiving yards in two games, we want to see more from Drake in the passing game lest we start to slide him down from RB1/RB2 status to more of a flex pick. For now, keep him locked in, especially against a lackluster Lions defense.","If you're able to look past the disappointing three-catch output from Robinson in Week 2, the nine targets he received -- along with healthy playing time -- are still what we've come to expect from the star receiver. Facing a very porous Atlanta defense that's allowed 78 scoreboard points through two weeks, look for Robinson to get back on track as Mitchell Trubisky's top option in the Chicago passing game.","A quiet second showing for Johnson included just 3.8 yards per touch. A lack of playmaking as a receiver limited the fantasy fun this past Sunday. The remedy, unfortunately, might not be found in the matchup this week, as the Steelers are ceding just 3.89 yards per carry to backs, sixth fewest in the league. Given the suspect matchup, Johnson makes for a flex option in Week 3.","Even if he's not so efficient while doing so, Gordon is expected to be quite busy as the lead back for Denver in the games ahead. With Phillip Lindsay sidelined for several weeks, Gordon consolidates strong rushing and receiving workloads. The Bucs have allowed the fewest yards per carry to backs thus far, but Gordon's busy role supports RB2 expectations. ","McLaurin is, by far, Washington's No. 1 receiver. He's garnered a high 26.6% target share, fueling a bulky 32.9% of the club's yards through the air. The Browns will no doubt key on McLaurin in their Week 3 encounter, but he's athletic enough to still have a productive afternoon. The lone bright spot in the Washington passing attack checks in with WR2 status.","In what could be a harbinger of the next few weeks, Engram was the Giants No. 1 receiver after both Saquon Barkley and Sterling Shepard were forced from last week's contest. The 49ers have been one of the best teams at defending the tight end so far in 2020, but they haven't faced anyone of Engram's ilk. Engram's volume alone places him as a low-end TE1 for Week 3.","Lamar Jackson completed just two passes deeper than 15 yards down the field in Week 2, a sure sign Brown had a quiet outing. With Mark Andrews consuming the valuable vertical work, Brown wasn't a fantasy factor this past week. Week 3 could prove more favorable for Brown, as the matchup isn't ideal but the workload could be great. If Baltimore has to keep pace with the Chiefs' offense, Brown could turn in a fun fantasy showing. ","Heading on the road to face Atlanta, the Bears will hope to avoid a repeat of the poor performance they demonstrated in their first away game (against Detroit) this season. Chicago looked solid against the Giants in Week 2 and should be a viable option as a D/ST most weeks, but the Falcons have posted 64 scoreboard points through two weeks and will be looking to bounce back and pick up their first win. Consider Chicago a low-end starting option in Week 3.","It's quite possible that Johnson is already the most valuable receiver on the roster for fantasy purposes; he's paced the team in targets by a significant margin all while averaging 2.1 yards per route. The Texans have been statistically solid against receivers this season, but Johnson merits interest as a solid WR2 thanks to his robust target clip.","An ankle injury kept Johnson off the field in Week 2. If he's good to go this week, Johnson is expected to serve a complementary role that doesn't create much fantasy impact.","There just isn't enough work each week to make Ruggs a fun fantasy option. Sure, it's early, but his role seems to serve more of an impact on stretching the field and changing coverage than him actually producing. Given his lack of usage, this matchup with New England is tough enough to avoid Ruggs in all leagues.",null,null,"Cousins completed only 11 passes in Week 2 and tossed three interceptions -- a horrible showing from a passer who does have QB1 upside in the right matchup. Needless to say, against the Titans he's a non-starter, as Tennesse does not provide a favorable enough matchup to roll with a passer in the midst of such a cold streak."],"4":["Career-lows in passing yards and yards per attempt suggest Week 3 was quite the outlier for Jackson. Moving on from such an ugly outing is a bit easier with a Washington defense dealing with injuries up front. Jackson is due to regain his dual-threat form this week as one of the slate's stronger plays.","Drake has received 18-plus touches in each game so far, which is almost enough to declare him a must-start without any other context. He hasn't found the end zone since Week 1, but that will balance out as the season goes along. The Arizona running back is a solid RB1 option against the Panthers in Week 4.","Robinson flourished in Week 3 despite having two different players under center during the contest. No matter who is at quarterback, Robinson is Chicago's top offensive option and will be a threat in the passing game every week. That remains true even against a very tough Indianapolis defense (fourth-fewest WR fantasy points allowed). Robinson is a low-end WR1 for Week 4.","Houston was held to only 29 net rushing yards in Week 3, the fourth fewest in a game in franchise history and the fewest since 2010. So that's not so good, but what's helpful is Johnson should prove busy in both phases in his capacity as a three-down threat. If Duke Johnson is at full power then this vet isn't as fun from a fantasy perspective, but either way makes for a solid play against a Vikings front allowing 136 rushing yards per game to backfields. ","In just his 10th career game with fewer than 10 carries, Gordon wasn't on the field as much in Week 3 and barely out-performed backfield mate Royce Freeman despite having lots more work. This all said, Gordon is the still the top back for this offense with Phillip Lindsay limited. The Jets, meanwhile, have allowed the ninth-most rushing yards (114.7) to backfields, aiding Gordon's upside for this week.","McLaurin is clearly Dwayne Haskins' go-to guy, getting at least seven looks per game on the way to 16 catches for 269 yards --  a healthy 16.8 yards per catch. Week 4 presents a challenge against the solid Ravens defense. However, with no one else for Haskins to fully trust, McLaurin's athletic ability should be able to shake free for WR2 production.","Engram's production across the board remains down from last season, even though his role should have increased with both Saquon Barkley and Sterling Shepard out last week. The Giants need Engram to step up -- and he has a chance to do so against a Rams defense that has given up  three touchdowns to tight ends. Look for a rebound from Engram who checks in as a low-end TE1 for Week 4.","Even when he doesn't produce, the advanced metrics seem to suggest Brown is due for some big plays soon. For instance, Brown caught just two of his six looks in Week 3, but also averaged an awesome 14.2 air yards per target. With some positive regression on the way soon for his profile, Brown is in a good spot facing a Washington secondary that can struggle with speed.","The Bears have snagged an interception in each game so far but otherwise have lacked the pass rush and turnover generation to be a top-end fantasy D/ST. This week against Indianapolis, consider them as a low-end starting option, especially since Philip Rivers and company have given the ball away only three times so far this season.","This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","Expected to play complementary role whenever healthy, Johnson Jr. isn't a viable fantasy flex with David Johnson playing on so many snaps. ","Ruled out with knee and hamstring injuries, Ruggs missed this past week and isn't a lock for work against this stingy Buffalo defense. Given the Bills' proven and deep coverage group, it's fine to simply stash Ruggs ahead of this meeting.",null,null,"Cousins has become a very TD-dependent fantasy quarterback, racking up start-worthy point totals in the two games in which he's scored touchdowns, and providing a matchup-losing total in Week 2 when he failed to find paydirt. That inconsistency doesn't bode well against a Houston defense allowing the ninth-fewest points to opposing passers this year. Keep Cousins on the bench for this one."],"5":["Jackson reached 20.1 MPH on the long rushing score he delivered in Week 4, his fastest speed on any of his 13 career rushing touchdowns. Jackson gained 33 yards after contact on the play after stiff-arming Landon Collins, the second-most yards after contact on any rush of his career. Next up is a Bengals defense ranked 21st in pressure rate, with Jackson poised for yet another sweet line.","Drake had a bit of an injury concern in Week 4 against the Panthers, but assuming nothing comes up in the injury report this week, he should be a solid option against the Jets. New York ranks among the 10 best matchups for opposing backs so far this season, and Drake had 18-plus touches in each of his first three healthy games.","Robinson went over 100 yards for the second time in a row in Week 4 despite a poor overall performance from his offense. With 23 targets over the last two weeks, he's one of the most reliable producers at the WR position in fantasy, no matter the quality of his offense. Trust him with a spot in your lineup, especially against a Tampa Bay defense that just allowed some big plays to the Chargers.","The return of Duke Johnson has seen this veteran back lose some work on third downs, as his snap rate slipped to a season-low 59% in Week 4. With the need to maximize his early-down touches now that he has real competition for targets, Johnson at least faces an inviting matchup against a Jaguars front allowing 104.3 rushing yards per game to backs. ","Delivering his second career game with at least 100 rushing yards and two rushing scores, Gordon's breakout effort for Denver in Week 4 helps his case as a solid starter in Week 5. The Patriots are slipping a bit against the run in allowing 4.4 yards per carry to backs, setting up Gordon with solid potential as an RB2 or flex candidate. ","McLaurin continues to excel in one of the least-potent offenses in the NFL. In Week 4, the second-year wideout cleared triple-digits for the second time in four games, generating 118 yards on 10 grabs. McLaurin should again be Dwayne Hoskins Jr.'s favorite target against a Rams defense likely to pressure the quarterback all game long. Even though he's only tallied one touchdown so far this season, McLaurin's volume alone should land him as a low-end WR1.","In Week 4, Engram benefited from being Daniel Jones' safety valve with 10 targets, but he was only able to haul in six catches for 35 yards. The Rams defense didn't allow Engram to shake loose and gain many yards after the catch. This week portends to be much better as the Giants face the Cowboys and their leaky pass defense. Engram is a low-end TE1, drawing a Dallas defense responsible for allowing an average of 6.5 catches for 64 yards a game to opposing tight ends, along with a score in each of the past three games.","This big-play maven had a touchdown called back by just a hair and impressively earned 210 air yards and eight targets on just 19 routes. Even in a game that saw the Ravens spread tons of rushing touches to their backfield, Brown was able to eat. Next up is an exploitable Bengals defense allowing 36 fantasy points per game to receivers.","The Bears D/ST has been making some moves through four weeks, but not enough to provide a consistent threat for fantasy purposes. Tom Brady and the Buccaneers have turned the ball over more than expected, but they also score a ton of points. Consider other options for Week 5.","Surging in regards to his target share of the offense and yards per opportunity this season, Johnson is likely to return from a concussion just in time for this choice matchup with a Philadelphia defense struggling to contain playmakers in space. If enjoys continues to be a top target in this offense, the outcome spectrum is fairly exciting this week.","Dealt four targets on 14 routes this past week, Johnson appears to have reclaimed his third-down role for Houston. The Colts have a rangy crew of linebackers, which serves curbs Johnson's appeal as a receiver in space. Given the Jaguars have solid defensive rates against running backs in the passing phase, Johnson isn't a fantasy factor this week.","A hamstring injury is expected to sidelined Ruggs for this matchup with a solid Kansas City defense allowing the fewest fantasy points to receivers.",null,null,"Cousins and the Vikings may have picked up the win in Week 4, but the Minnesota quarterback did not do anything to earn a win in fantasy. He did keep a zero in the interception column for the first time this season, but failed to produce big numbers. Even against a shaky Seattle defense, he's not a fantasy option for Week 5."],"6":["A somewhat quiet statistical outing in a drubbing of the Bengals included just two rushing attempts for three yards for Jackson. With a comfortable lead throughout, Jackson was never taxed with creating out of the pocket, but that could change this week against a Philadelphia defense that claims the third-highest sack rate in the league. The Eagles are susceptible to the big play in the passing game and also against the run in the second level, ideal for Jackson's skill set.","The top-end production isn't there for Drake so far this season, but the volume most certainly is. With 85 rushing attempts in five games, he's almost guaranteed a floor of a handful of rushing points. Plus, after finding the end zone once again in Week 5, there's hope that he'll post a bigger fantasy point total this week against a mediocre Dallas defense. Consider him an RB2 for Week 6.","Against the Buccaneers in Week 5, Robinson hauled in 10 receptions for the second time in three weeks. He's certainly been a beneficiary of Chicago's change to QB Nick Foles. The consistent targets and decent production mean he's a solid WR2 in all formats and a low-end WR1 in deeper leagues, even against a tougher Carolina pass defense.","While he's yet to match his Week 1 performance, it's worth noting Johnson has posted at least 11 fantasy points in all but one outing this season thanks to regularly handling a sizable workload for Houston. Even when it's not pretty, Johnson's big role helps him grind out solid lines, such as last week's 103 scrimmage yards thanks to being on the field for nearly 80% of the team's offensive plays. Given his busy role, Johnson can best his strong debut against a Titans defense allowing the most yards per carry to tailbacks among AFC teams.","Delivering his second career game with at least 100 rushing yards and two rushing scores, Gordon's breakout effort for Denver in Week 4 helps his case as a solid starter in Week 6. The Patriots are slipping a bit against the run in allowing 4.4 yards per carry to backs, setting up Gordon with solid potential as an RB2 or flex candidate. ","Perhaps because he missed demoted QB Dwayne Haskins, McLaurin posted just three catches for 26 yards in Week 5, both season-lows. McLaurin is talented enough to develop a quick rapport with either Kyle Allen or Alex Smith, so expect the sophomore's production to pick up against a middle-of-the-road Giants pass defense. Despite the struggles, McLaurin remains a solid WR2 option.","After a busy Week 4, Engram was quiet last Sunday, save for a nifty three-yard rushing touchdown against the Cowboys. Engram should see the football sent his way often in Week 6 as Washington does a good job pressuring the quarterback. When they do come for him, Daniel Jones will need to rely on his big tight end a lot. Engram is secure as a low-end TE1.","Playing a career-high 86 percent of his team's snaps in Week 5, Brown ran a route on 97% of Lamar Jackson's dropbacks while consuming a robust 40% of the team's total air yardage. Which is to say, the arrow is pointing up for Brown as a big-play threat for Baltimore as the Ravens face an Eagles' defense allowing the seventh-most fantasy points per game to receivers.","The Bears faced a depleted Tampa Bay offense in Week 5 and put forth a respectable performance. With the Panthers missing their superstar running back, Week 6 shouldn't be all that different. Consider them a low-end starting option given their ability to both prevent scoring and to rack up a few sacks here and there.","Held to just four snaps before exiting with a back injury against the Eagles last week, Johnson's status for this looming matchup with Cleveland will prove critical for fantasy purposes. Early reports suggest the team expects Johnson back in the mix this week against a Browns defense allowing the second-most fantasy points per game to receivers. With a sweet matchup in place, Johnson would be a solid flex candidate if he's good to go.","David Johnson ran a route on 23 of the team's 38 passing dropbacks in Week 5, leaving Johnson Jr. with just 10 routes and a single target. Such usage isn't very encouraging under a new coaching structure and reveals just how risky of a play this change-of-pace back proves against the rival Titans this week.",null,null,null,"Cousins tossed an interception and lost a fumble in Week 5 -- his third straight game with multiple turnovers. However, he will face the league's best matchup for opposing quarterbacks in fantasy (Atlanta) in Week 6, so if you need a spot-starter, you could do a lot worse than Cousins. He has previously proven to have multi-TD upside and could well deliver big numbers against the Falcons."],"8":["Including their recent win over the Eagles, the Ravens have scored at least 20 points in 29 consecutive games, breaking a tie with the \"Greatest Show on Turf\" Rams for the longest such streak in league history.

Yet with Jackson at the helm of a such a consistently productive offense, he remains firmly in the QB1 tier for this matchup of rivals.",null,"Robinson's status for Week 8 will depend entirely on his health.

It is a bit worrisome that Gordon and Phillip Lindsay split work nearly evenly before Lindsay left with an injury last week, but there is also real potential for the Broncos to feature Gordon in a pivotal game against his former team. With the Chargers 24.3 fantasy points per game to backfields, there is room for Gordon to meet and even exceed his projection.",null,"Engram managed six catches for 46 yards in Week 7's Thursday night affair, but a critical fourth quarter drop drew the ire of his fantasy managers, not to mention Giants fans. Unfortunately, a rebound will be challenging as next up is a Buccaneers defense yielding the seventh-fewest TE fantasy points per game. Engram can be considered no higher than streaming territory.","The man known as \"Hollywood\" led all of Baltimore's skill players with 62 offensive snaps in Week 6, but was only afforded six targets in the win over the Eagles. With Lamar Jackson only completing 37% of his passes of at least 15 yards downfield, the fifth-worst in NFL, there is some risk in trusting Brown's vertical role some weeks. Then again, Pittsburgh has allowed the third-highest completion rate on such deep throws this year.","The Bears found the end zone on defense in Week 7 which boosted their score to cover for otherwise unimpressive counting stats (one takeaway and one sack). However, it was this D/ST's third double-digit fantasy scoring effort this season.  A matchup with the Saints looms in Week 8, however, meaning it would be a big risk to keep this unit in your starting D/ST spot for fantasy.","We are learning that whenever he's at full strength, Johnson is the top target in this passing game. With both volume and big-play ability working in his favor, Johnson makes for a solid WR2 even amid a difficult matchup with Baltimore.",null,"Nelson Agholor thrived as the Raiders' big-play threat down the field in Week 7, leaving this rookie with just three targets.

While he's not matching his MVP production from last season, Jackson's dual-threat potential remains potent enough to earn him a starting spot in this tough matchup against a Colts defense allowing the fewest fantasy points per game to quarterbacks.","Drake is unlikely to suit up for Week 9 against the Dolphins, his former team, leaving the RB duties to Chase Edmonds for the contest.","Last week against the Saints, Robinson found the end zone for the first time since Week 4. He'll look to keep that momentum going against a Tennessee team that has allowed the second-most WR fantasy points per game this season. A high-volume wideout in a great matchup is a must-start in all leagues for Week 9.","A great workload in his role as the Texans' lead back has Johnson averaging nearly 19 touches and 87 scrimmage yards the past four outings. The Jaguars have struggled against the run this season in allowing 104.7 rushing yards per game to tailbacks, setting up Johnson as a solid RB2 with a real shot to meet and even exceed his projection.","Six receptions salvaged an ugly showing for Gordon in Week 8 against his former team. The bruising back was held to just 3.25 yards per carry in the win, while Phillip Lindsay continues to prove more efficient on a per-touch basis. As long as Gordon enjoys rewarding red zone and third-down roles, he's the strongest fantasy option from this backfield in what is a somewhat challenging matchup against an Atlanta defense that surprisingly has allowed the fourth-fewest rushing yards per game to backfields.","In Week 7's win over the Cowboys, McLaurin snapped his scoring drought, finding the end zone for the first time since the second game of the season. A 52-yard scoring strike punctuated another productive day where he caught seven balls for 90 yards. McLaurin lines up for another solid effort on Sunday as Washington hosts a below-average Giants defense.","Engram posted another solid effort on Monday, securing 5-of-10 targets for 61 yards. The volume was good to see after he had dropped a couple of key passes in Week 7. Despite failing to reach the end zone thus far in 2020, Engram's floor keeps him as a TE1, with a favorable matchup on tap for Week 9 in Washington, a defense allowing the seventh-most TE fantasy points this season.","A short score saved an otherwise quiet outing for Brown against a Pittsburgh defense intent on stopping his vertical playmaking. Brown ran the most routes and played the most snaps of all skill players for the team, so the weak numbers weren't for a lack of exposure. The matchup doesn't get much sweeter with the Colts' solid secondary on deck, but you can expect Brown to be on the field for nearly every one of Lamar Jackson's dropbacks.","The Bears failed to generate any turnovers against the Saints in Week 8, only their second game this season without one. Next up for Chicago is a matchup with Tennessee, which struggled versus the Bengals last week. A solid record of preventing scoreboard points (no more than 26 in any game this season) and fairly consistent takeaways mean this is a decent (albeit low-upside) D/ST pick for Week 9.","An early injury scare saw Johnson limited for portions of the team's win over the Ravens, but he still led the team in routes run and air yardage per target. This said, the injury seemed to limit Johnson to just one catch in the outing. Odds are a bigger workload and line await him against this soft Dallas secondary.","Averaging just shy of six touches per game for roughly 30 scrimmage yards per game in a complementary role for the Texans during the past four games, Johnson doesn't see the field enough to merit interest from fantasy managers. The Jaguars offer a nice matchup, but Johnson isn't in a position to produce.","If he's not purely a decoy, per se, Ruggs serves a field-stretching role for the Raiders that doesn't show up very often in the box score.

While many of these targets come deep down the field and thus have some real potential, the floor is low for this rookie heading into a tough matchup.",null,null,"Cousins attempted only 14 passes as the running game led by Dalvin Cook did most of the work in an upset win over the Packers. That's one of several risks when considering Cousins as your fantasy starter -- the others being his inefficiency and turnover-prone nature.

Chase Edmonds did not impress in his Week 9 start, so we'd expect to see Drake back on top of the depth chart if healthy against a middling Buffalo defense. He's a solid RB2 and starter in nearly every league if active.","Robinson has finished only two games this season with fewer than nine targets, so while his final output might not always be impressive, his volume is as consistent as any player in the NFL. Nick Foles will look to him early and often against a Minnesota defense that's near the top of the league in points per game allowed to opposing receivers, so Robinson is a solid choice as a WR1 in all leagues this week.","Johnson left Week 9's win over the Jaguars after just two touches with a potential concussion and didn't return to action. With Johnson consuming a heavy workload in games prior to getting injured, he would retain low-end RB2 value if active for this matchup with the Browns, a team that has been effective in slowing down opposing backs for much of the season.","Ugly efficiency rates are catching up with Gordon, as the veteran tailback averaged just 3.9 yards per touch this past week and yet again was out-produced by backfield peer Phillip Lindsay. Targeted just once despite running 27 routes in Week 9, Gordon's investors can at least gain some confidence in him as a flex option for Week 10 if for the matchup alone, as the Raiders have allowed the fourth-most fantasy points per game to backs this season.","In Week 9, McLaurin cemented his status as one of the game's top wideouts in Washington's 23-20 loss to the Giants, catching seven of eight targets for 115 yards while finding the end zone for the second straight game. Despite uneven quarterback play, McLaurin is matchup-proof with a chance for another huge game against the Lions subpar defense in Week 10.","It took until Week 9, but Engram finally entered the scoring column, finding paydirt for the first time this season. For the day, he hauled in half of his 10 targets for 48 yards. This week, the Giants entertain the Eagles and the third most generous defense with respect to tight end points, rendering Engram as a solid start.","Tweeting about wanting more targets didn't seem to work for Brown this past week, as the second-year speedster connected on just three of his five looks from Lamar Jackson in the win over the Colts. This marked Brown's third game of the season with fewer than four receptions, so you'll be banking on his big-play ability to overcome both poor usage and matchup metrics against a solid Patriots pass defense in Week 10.","The Bears are one of the most consistent D/ST options in fantasy at this point, with five or more fantasy points in five of nine contests so far and no negative outputs. They haven't shown a high ceiling that often, and a matchup with a surging Minnesota offense isn't great, but it's impossible to deny this defense's ability. With at least one sack in every game, and having allowed over 20 scoreboard points just four times this season, Chicago is a solid low-end starting option at D/ST.","A busy target of Ben Roethlisberger's the past several weeks, Johnson remains a weekly fantasy starter even amid a series of minor injuries this season. Next up is an inviting matchup with an exploitable Cincinnati back seven, with Johnson positioned as a solid flex play in PPR formats.","Afforded a big workload with David Johnson leaving the game on the first drive, Johnson Jr. wasn't very effective in netting shy of 2.6 yards per carry, but he did deliver his first touchdown of the campaign while having a respectable day from scrimmage. The main takeaway from this backfield is that Johnson Jr. would only be a meaningful fantasy flex this week against his former team if Johnson misses more time.","He was held to under five targets for the fifth-consecutive game, and this was the first time he didn't catch any of his targets.

Chicago has been the toughest defense to score fantasy points against this season for opposing passers, meaning Cousins should not factor into your Week 10 plans."],"11":["Jackson struggled throwing down the field against New England, completing just one of six attempts of at least 15 yards in the loss. A strong bounce-back performance could be in store for Jackson and Baltimore's offense, however, with the Titans one of just nine team allowing at least 20 fantasy points per game to opposing passers.","After missing Week 9 with an ankle injury, Drake returned on Sunday, registering his second 100-yard game of the season on 16 carries while also capturing one pass for 16 yards. Drake remains in a timeshare with Chase Edmonds, making him a week-to-week matchup play. With the weak Seahawks defense on tap, Drake is a flex-level play. However, if you start him, do so as a running back, since his game is the Thursday night affair. It's always prudent to leave your flex spot open.",null,null,"Denver tilted their offense to the passing game with 47 attempts this past week, while an inefficient running phase was afforded just 19 total attempts. Gordon hasn't been productive on the ground in several weeks now, which means he enters this matchup with a mediocre Miami rush defense as merely a low-end flex candidate.","Superlatives are running thin when describing McLaurin's play. In Week 10, he posted 95 receiving yards on seven catches (alongside a 27-yard run) as Washington fell a little short in a tough loss to Detroit. McLaurin should have no issues running wild in the Bengals secondary when Cincinnati visits Washington for a Week 11 gridiron meeting.",null,"Still unable to connect on vertical work with Lamar Jackson, Brown netted just two catches this past Sunday while seeing a team-high 18.3 air yards per target in the loss. With Jackson struggling to connect on throws of at least 15 yards this season (ranked 28th in completion rate on such throws), Brown enters this plus matchup with a porous Tennessee pass defense with notable volatility as a fantasy option.",null,"This past week somehow marked Johnson's first 100-yard game of his career. Looking to build on the strong showing, this versatile playmaker next faces a Jacksonville secondary allowing the 11th-most fantasy points per game to wideouts. ","Even as the team featured Johnson out of the backfield this past week, he saw just a single target on his 23 routes in the loss and didn't help fantasy managers in the outing. With David Johnson placed on injured reserve, Johnson Jr. should see another chance to shine, this time against a Patriots' defense allowing a generous 4.6 yards per carry to backs.","Seemingly a decoy on this offense serving to help stretch the field with the threat of his game-changing speed, Ruggs has topped 35 yards just twice this season. The last time he topped this mark was actually in Week 5 against the Chiefs in what was a career outing for the rookie. Given how capable the Chiefs have proven in coverage, Ruggs enters with a very low fantasy floor.",null,null,"Prior to Week 10, Cousins' record as a starter in Monday night games was a pathetic 0-9. It's now a slightly less disappointing 1-9 as he completed 25-of-36 throws for a pair of touchdowns in the Vikings' 19-13 decision over the Bears. Still, the veteran's inconsistency, along with the Vikings' reliance on Dalvin Cook renders the signal-caller as a fantasy non-factor when Minnesota hosts Dallas this week."],"12":["The Titans stifled the Baltimore passing game for much of Week 11's contest, leaving Jackson with a modest fantasy tally. The road doesn't get smoother this week, as the rival Steelers have the league's highest sack rate and second-highest pressure rate on opposing signal-callers. Thanks to the relatively high floor Jackson's rushing prowess supports, he's still solidly in the starting tier at his position, but with somewhat tempered expectations given the matchup.","Over the past two games, Drake may have been splitting snaps with Chase Edmonds (71 for Drake, 72 for Edmonds) but he saw the bulk of the touches out of the Arizona backfield (32-of-49). That means he's still the top option for the Cardinals as a fantasy starter. He should be considered a solid RB2 against a tough New England run defense, which is among the 10 toughest to score fantasy points against for opposing backs.","Outside of a four-target outlier against the elite Rams' pass defense, Robinson has been a consistent source of seven-plus targets per game. That alone makes him a lock for all fantasy lineups this week against the Packers, since pass-catchers who get ample opportunities provide a solid floor and consistent output.",null,"This scoring maven has seven touchdowns on the season after producing two rushing scores for the second time this year in a win over the Dolphins. A key drawback in his production profile, however, is the fact that touchdowns account for nearly 40% of his fantasy production on the campaign, signaling a dependence on scoring success to deliver worthy fantasy results. This means that Gordon, who is part of a committee approach along with Phillip Lindsay, will split work in a tough matchup against a New Orleans front yielding just the second-fewest fantasy points per game to backfields.","In Week 11, McLaurin posted what's become a typical solid effort, snagging five balls for 84 yards as Washington defeated Cincinnati. However, he missed practice on Monday due to a sore ankle and it's unclear if he'll be ready to travel to Dallas on Thursday for another showdown between NFC East rivals. If McLaurin suits up, he's a clear start. Just make sure to check the inactives report prior to carving that turkey.","After three weeks of solid production, Engram only caught two balls for 15 yards in Week 10. Engram emerges from the Week 11 bye with a good chance of getting back on track when the Giants visit Cincinnati. Be sure to get Engram back in your Week 12 lineups as he'll line up against a Bengals defense allowing the fourth-most TE fantasy points per game.","It's not encouraging for Brown's fantasy appeal that he's now endured four straight games with fewer than four receptions. \"Hollywood\" entered the end zone against the Steelers back in Week 8, but was also held a single catch for three yards in that outing. The Steelers have allowed a relatively high rate of splash plays via the air this season, confirmed by allowing the fourth-most yards per catch to wideouts on the year, but Brown's floor is obviously quite low heading into this rematch.","The Bears have been one of the better fantasy D/ST options this season, but a matchup with Green Bay will provide a tough test. Coming off a bye week, this unit might be on waivers and worth a pickup over your current D/ST option. Just be cautious against a tough opponent. ","A target hog when he's fully healthy, Johnson has commanded roughly 30% of the team's target market in the game's he's played a full batch of snaps. With eight more targets than any of his teammates this past week and real value as a WR2 candidate this week, it's worth looking past Johnson's quiet Week 8 outing against the Ravens.","There has long been a section of fantasy managers clamoring for Johnson Jr. to assume a featured role in an NFL offense, yet he's averaged just 3.3 yards per touch in his past two outings as Houston's lead back. There is some real potential, however, for those managers to finally earn a payoff given that Detroit has allowed the most fantasy points per game to backfields.","Even as Derek Carr is enjoying a strong season, this rookie speedster simply can't untracked. It doesn't help that he's often serving as a field-stretching decoy and not an actual focus of the offense, a reality that limits his fantasy appeal for this meeting with Atlanta's porous pass defense.",null,null,"Cousins found success in Week 11 against a porous Dallas defense, connecting on three TD passes and going over 300 yards for only the second time this season. However, with Adam Thielen on the reserve/COVID-19 list heading into Week 12, there's worry that the Vikings will be thinner at receiver than usual. This development makes Cousins a very risky fantasy option against a decent Carolina defense."],"13":["Absent from the field in Week 12 due to COVID-19 protocol, the Ravens' offense struggled to move the ball against the stout Steelers front. If he's active for Week 13, Jackson's dual-threat abilities help support a relatively stable fantasy floor. The ceiling hasn't been nearly as high as last season's MVP opus, but Jackson is still a fine starting fantasy option if active in time for this tilt with a Dallas defense allowing the 10th-most fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks.","They might be splitting playing time fairly evenly, but Drake and Chase Edmonds are by no means splitting the RB workload from a fantasy perspective. The Cardinals are still leaning heavily on Drake early and often -- especially as a runner -- and he's the preferred option in fantasy leagues as a result. Coming off of a 2-TD performance and facing a Rams team that's tough to pass against, he's a solid RB2 option in all formats.","Robinson didn't miss a step with a different quarterback under center, handling 13 targets and scoring twice with Mitchell Trubisky running the show in Week 12. He'll get a chance to do even better in Week 13 against one of the weakest defenses in football (Detroit). Keep him locked into your lineups no matter who winds up leading the huddle in Chicago.",null,"Without any threat of a passing game, the Denver backfield struggled to get untracked against a stacked New Orleans front. If Phillip Lindsay's knee injury suffered last week limits him at all, we could see Gordon handle additional work, but both game script (i.e. trailing big to the Chiefs) and his own lack of rushing efficiency leaves Gordon as a borderline flex play.","McLaurin continued his solid play on Thanksgiving, handling 7-of-9 targets for 92 yards as Washington squashed Dallas. McLaurin is matchup proof, although he will be challenged by the tough Steelers defense when TFT heads to Pittsburgh for one of Week 13's Monday tilts.","Buoyed by a 53-yard catch-and-run, Engram eclipsed the century mark in receiving for the first time this season in Week 12, amassing 129 yards on six receptions. Next up is a Seattle defense adept at defending the tight end. That said, Engram is still a solid Week 13 play, regardless of whether it ends up being Daniel Jones or Colt McCoy under center.","There haven't been many marquee performances from \"Hollywood\" this season, as Baltimore's deep-passing metrics are among the worst in the league. There is always some upside present in his fantasy profile given his deep speed, especially in a nice matchup with a Dallas defense allowing the fourth-most fantasy points ","The Chicago defense didn't even come close to getting Aaron Rodgers on the ground or taking the ball away from the Green Bay offense in Week 12. Remember though, that's the Green Bay offense. Detroit offers a much more favorable matchup for opposing D/STs (four giveaways and only 25 total scoreboard points over the last two games), so Chicago is a recommended addition to your fantasy lineup if you're looking for a Week 13 upgrade.","An ugly Week 12 saw Johnson peppered with a team-leading 13 targets and riddled by drops. With at least three dropped passes in the win over the Ravens, Johnson is looking for a bounce-back showing against Washington's respectable secondary.","Yet to get untracked as a rusher, Johnson Jr. at least delivered a strong receiving performance in the Texans' rousing win over the Lions on Thanksgiving. With David Johnson likely still on the mend, Johnson Jr. should see another solid batch of touches in this difficult matchup with the Colts, setting him up as a somewhat risky flex play.","Averaging a nearly ridiculous 19.6 air yards per target in Week 12, Ruggs was once again more of a decoy for the Raiders than a key target in the offense. It was nice to see him net five targets, tying his career high, but you'd need to be in a deep league or in a desperate scenario to deploy Ruggs against the Jets.",null,null,"Cousins did not appear to struggle without Adam Thielen in the lineup in Week 12, tossing a trio of touchdowns for the third time in four games. He's been performing well in good matchups of late, and he'll get another one of those against Jacksonville in Week 13. He's not consistent enough to declare as a must-start, but if you need a one-week replacement under center for your fantasy squad, you could do far worse than Cousins."],"14":["Even amid a quieter statistical season than last year's MVP opus, Jackson has still flashed his dual-threat abilities, as he just produced his sixth game with at least one rushing and passing score since the start of last season, third most in the NFL during this sample. While the rival Browns have been solid at times on defense this season, they've also ceded 19.7 fantasy points per game to opposing signal-callers, right in line with Jackson's projection this week.","In Week 13, Drake found the end zone to help him salvage an otherwise lackluster outing against the Rams. Los Angeles does have one of the best defenses in football, however, so don't count this as a massive failure for the Alabama product by any means. Instead, keep him in your lineup for a much more favorable matchup with the Giants in Week 14.","In Week 13, Robinson registered his sixth straight game with six-plus receptions. However, his upside has been a bit muted of late. When he's not finding the end zone, Robinson is not getting the huge catch or yardage totals needed to help you win a fantasy matchup. That said, he still delivers starter-worthy points every week and belongs in your lineup against the weak Houston defense.","With just two more touches than backfield peer Duke Johnson this past Sunday, Johnson's return to action after missing several weeks wasn't so impressive, although he did at least deliver a touchdown. Even on a team that does much better moving the ball via the air than the ground, the fact that Chicago has allowed nearly 100 rushing yards per game to backfields aids Johnson's case as a potential flex option this week.","It was fun to see Gordon establish a season-high in rushing and scrimmage yardage this past Sunday night, but less exciting to note he hasn't scored in five of his past six outings. While the team is still splitting early-down touches nearly evenly between Gordon and Phillip Lindsay, this looming matchup with a Panthers defense that ranks in the bottom tier against opposing backs supports flex value this week.","With McLaurin drawing extra attention from the Pittsburgh secondary and Alex Smith forced to get rid of the ball quickly, Washington was content looking elsewhere in their early Monday takedown of the previously undefeated Steelers. After catching just 2-of-6 targets for 14 yards in Week 13, McLaurin should return to form in Week 14, facing a more vulnerable San Francisco defense on the road.","After a season-best 129 receiving yards in Week 12, Engram managed just 32 yards on four catches in Week 13. Colt McCoy, the injury replacement at quarterback, worked underneath for most of the Giants' stunner in Seattle. Jones is hoping to return in Week 14, which would benefit Engram as the two have been able to stretch the field. Engram is an automatic start regardless, but he has a higher ceiling with Jones calling the shots.","Touchdowns in consecutive weeks has helped Brown's fantasy stock heading into a matchup with the Browns. Even as Cleveland has struggled in coverage on the outside at times this season, Brown's boom-or-bust profile in a low-end passing game limits the appeal, and he's found outside of flex territory this week.","The Bears put forth a disappointing effort as a D/ST in Week 13 against the Lions, all but eliminating them from consideration against the talented Houston offense in Week 14. Using ESPN standard scoring, this unit has actually cost you six points over the last two games. Yikes!","A dozen targets and a touchdown defined a strong Week 13 performance for Johnson, who has led the Steelers in target share whenever he's healthy. The Bills have been solid in coverage for much of the season, but Johnson's volume-driven role supports a relatively stable fantasy floor.","Mostly isolated to a change-of-pace role in the passing game, Johnson Jr. only touched the ball twice on the ground this past Sunday. A limited role and the presence of David Johnson makes Duke Johnson an unappealing option for fantasy purposes against the Bears this week.","An effective double-move in the final seconds of Week 13's tilt with the Jets saw Ruggs create a ton of separation on his way to the game-winning touchdown. Carr's game-winning score to Ruggs had 44 air yard, matching the second-most air yards on a touchdown in Carr's career. This big play pattern seems unlikely to continue into Week 14 against a top pass defense.",null,null,"Cousins has tossed a trio of TD passes in three straight outings, going over 300 yards in each contest. His next opponent is not particularly formidable, as the Buccaneers have been among the better QB fantasy matchups this season, especially of late. Overall, Cousins has tended to be fairly inconsistent, but if you're in need of a waiver-wire quarterback for Week 14, he is certainly a viable option."],"15":["A slow start led to an amazing performance for Jackson this past Monday evening, as he tallied 124 rushing yards and two scores, marking the most rushing yards by a quarterback in Monday Football history and his eighth career 100-yard game on the ground, second only to Mike Vick in NFL history. A soft matchup with the Jaguars sets up Jackson as an elite fantasy starter this week.","When the Cardinals are near the end zone, there's really only one player their offense is focusing on in order to get the score. Drake has been trusted with more than 10 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line since his return from injury in Week 10 -- and he's scored four touchdowns over that span. The Eagles have a strong run defense, but so have many of Drake's recent opponents. Keep him locked in to your starting lineup for Week 15.","It's easy to forget about Robinson when discussing the league's elite wideouts, but he frequently jumps out and reminds us of what he can do. His chemistry with Mitchell Trubisky is clear to see and they'll next face a Minnesota defense which left Tampa Bay's receivers wide open all day in Week 14. Robinson is a great pick for your Week 15 lineups.","Expected to return from the Covid-19 list this week and having missed much of November to an injury, Johnson enters Week 15 with pronounced risk as a fantasy option given the Colts have allowed the eighth-fewest rushing yards to tailbacks on the year.","Earning just one more snap than Phillip Lindsay this past week, Gordon still proved productive against Carolina thanks to earning six first downs on 16 touches to Lindsay's two on 13 touches. With the more rewarding red zone role and greater upside in the receiving department of the two backs, Gordon makes for a reasonable flex play against the Bills this week.","For the second straight week, the opposing team focused on containing McLaurin. For the second straight week, that strategy resulted in a loss. The 49ers did limit the star wideout to just two receptions on six targets for 24 yards. Even so, McLaurin remains a must-start with the weak Seahawks secondary on tap in Week 15. There's a great likelihood that Alex Smith will be back at the helm after leaving Week 14 early for precautionary reasons. Hopefully, the \"stop McLaurin\" strategy will not be in effect after two weeks of Washington wins when opponents utilized this losing gameplan.","Engram posted his second straight sub-par performance in Week 14, capturing only 2-of-4 targets for 18 yards as the Giants offense couldn't get anything going in their disappointing loss to the Cardinals. Look for Engram to rebound against a Cleveland defense allowing the second-most TE fantasy points per game when the Giants and Browns clash in Week 15.","A dangerous vertical threat with some drop issues, Brown delivered a huge play this past Monday to help save his fantasy value. This next matchup with the Jaguars is quite inviting given that they've ceded 39 fantasy points per game to receivers, but there is also some risk given Brown's volatile game log.","The Bears shut down Houston's offense in Week 14, racking up a season-high seven sacks and limiting the Texans to only seven scoreboard points. This performance is a bit of an outlier, but Chicago has popped up with double-digit fantasy point performances in five games this season. Against a Minnesota team in the midst of a tough playoff hunt (and with an offensive line that just allowed plenty of sacks of their own against Tampa Bay), Chicago's D/ST is a viable low-end starting option in Week 15.","Dropping 9.6% of his targets on the year is an ugly reality that has influenced Johnson's fantasy outcomes this season. With the likelihood he fully regains his every-down role this week after a momentary demotion last week, Johnson claims real upside against a porous pass defense this week.","Some splash plays in the passing game helped Johnson Jr. accumulate nearly 80 scrimmage yards this past week, but a lack of rushing usage and success kept him from having a truly fun fantasy showing. With David Johnson expected back this week, Johnson Jr. simply isn't helpful for fantasy purposes against a stingy Colts defense.","A vertical burner without a very stable target share, it's tough to deploy Ruggs deep into the fantasy playoffs given such a low-volume role. The Chargers have struggled on defense lately, but this isn't the guy to trust.",null,null,"Cousins has now lost a fumble in four straight games, so while his three 300-yard performances and 10 touchdowns with just one interception seem decent, it's important to remember that other variety of turnover and its impact on scoring in most leagues. Add to that a matchup with a rock-solid Chicago defense in Week 15, and this veteran signal-caller is trending the wrong way for fantasy purposes. Search the waiver wire for a better starter in Week 15."],"16":["A quiet statistical stretch in the middle of the season has given way to an awesome finish for Jackson, who has topped 25 fantasy in three straight weeks in ESPN standard scoring. Just this past week, Jackson delivered in a nice matchup in producing his ninth career game with at least one rushing and one passing score, tying Kyler Murray for second in such performances in the past three seasons behind only Josh Allen. The Giants have been largely solid on defense this season in yielding just the fifth-fantasy points to quarterbacks, but Jackson's dual-threat skill set positions him as a solid fantasy starter.","One week after handling 24 touches against the Giants, Drake had just 10 carries and a pair of receptions against the Eagles. He was out-snapped and out-played by Chase Edmonds. The split between the two will likely be even greater heading into this week's matchup with a tough San Francisco defense. Still, Drake's heavy usage as a red-zone back means that he belongs in your lineup. However, he's more of an RB2/flex this week.","Robinson was hardly needed in Week 15 as the Bears were able to run past the Vikings for the victory. The same could be true again in Week 16, as the Jaguars struggle to stop both the run and pass. Robinson has upside against such a weak defense, but is limited by Chicago's run-first offense. Consider him as a solid WR2 with a fairly wide range of outcomes.","With both of his backups sidelined by injury, Johnson consumed a big workload in Week 15 to the tune of 19 touches, leading to his second career outing with at least 100 receiving yards and a stellar 11 receptions. The performance marked the first 100-yard receiving game by a Texans back since Arian Foster in 2011. It's unclear if Johnson gets solo featured duties again this week, but it's quite clear the matchup is inviting with the Bengals allowing 4.9 yards per carry to backs, with only Houston ranking worse against the rush.","Delivering his third multi-touchdown showing of the season this past week, Gordon now has 56 scrimmage touchdowns the past five seasons, second only to Todd Gurley II. He wasn't able to do much against his former team in a Week 8 meeting, but Gordon is a nice flex play this week against the Chargers given Los Angeles hasn't been so stout against the run this season in allowing nearly 24 fantasy points per game to backfields.","With Dwayne Haskins taking to the air 55 times in Week 15, McLaurin was the intended receiver on a dozen balls, reeling in seven of them for 77 yards. It's unclear whether Haskins or Alex Smith will be at the helm for Washington's Week 16 home date with the Panthers. Either way, McLaurin is a strong play. Carolina is tied with the eighth-fewest sacks per game and, when Washington's quarterback has time, McLaurin usually flourishes.","Engram handled 4-of-7 Week 15 targets for 46 yards in the Giants' home loss to the Browns. The Giants next head to Baltimore for a Week 16 date with the Ravens. Baltimore defends tight ends well, but Engram's floor at a position devoid of many reliable options still lands him as a low-end TE1.","A sluggish production pattern through the first 11 weeks has turned into a nice stretch of statistics for Brown; he's been targeted a team-high 29 times in the past four games and has tallied at least 98 yards or a score each week. The Giants have surrendered the 13th-fewest fantasy points to wideouts on the year, although Brown's recent surge helps him maintain fantasy value.","The Bears will face the current holders of the No. 1 NFL Draft pick in Week 16, the Jacksonville Jaguars, in one of the \"must play\" matchups for a D/ST in fantasy. Chicago is a fine starting pick in any format against struggling Jacksonville.","Leading the Steelers in market share of the passing game once again, Johnson's dozen targets fueled a solid fantasy showing, even if he only netted 59 yards. The Colts have been solid in pass defense in yielding the 10th-fewest fantasy points to receivers, yet Johnson's slice of the offense keeps him in lineups.","Missing from the lineup last week due to injury, it appears Johnson Jr. would resume a change-of-pace role on third downs if active for this tilt with the Bengals. It helps that Cincinnati has been porous against backfields, but the workload appears too compromised to trust him in lineups.","Absent from last week's division matchup due to a COVID-19 protocols, this rookie speedster isn't going to help fantasy teams even if he's active for this matchup with Miami given that he's yet to top five targets in a single outing yet. ",null,null,"Cousins actually posted a decent fantasy output in Week 15 against the Bears. Still, the Minnesota quarterback has not been productive enough this season to earn the trust of fantasy managers in Week 16 against a Saints team surging toward the playoffs. "],"17":["A series of outcomes worked in Baltimore's favor this past week, including the Ravens winning against the Giants, thus the team knows that with a win over the Bengals in Week 17, theyâ€™ll secure a third-straight trip to the postseason. Jackson has produced passing multiple scores in three of the past four games and has rushed for at least 80 yards in three of those four games as well, setting him up as a high-end fantasy option for this final game of the regular season.","Those who stuck with Drake despite the tough Week 16 matchup were rewarded as he punched in a touchdown in an otherwise lackluster performance. Things only get tougher against the Rams in Week 17, but Drake's volume and red-zone work (26 carries inside the opponents' 20 since Week 12) mean he's a viable RB2/flex in all formats.","The Packers are strong against the pass, but Robinson did manage to score twice the last time these teams met. He's been alternating big performances and lackluster outings over recent weeks, but with everything on the line, Chicago will lean on their star wideout one last time in the regular season. You should do the same in your fantasy lineups.","A season-high 128 yards on the ground this past Sunday marked Johnson's first 100-yard rushing performance since Week 11 of the 2018 season with Arizona. Johnson only left the field for two snaps in the contest, as he's proven capable of handling a massive workload with the team missing an ailing Duke Johnson from the field to injury. The Titans are one of 11 teams allowing at least 100 rushing yards per game to backfields, supporting a high floor for Johnson this week.","Despite being held out of the end zone and not involved in the passing game this past week, Gordon did produce his 43rd career game with at least 60 rushing yards since entering the league in 2015, trailing only Ezekiel Elliott and Todd Gurley over this span. Held Gordon to 46 scoreless yards last time out against a generally porous Las Vegas rush defense, Gordon is in a better spot this time around with Phillip Lindsay no longer in the picture.","After missing Week 16 due to a high-ankle sprain, McLaurin's status for Week 17's critical trip to Philadelphia is unclear. The conundrum for fantasy managers is that this is latest kickoff on the schedule and McLaurin may be a game-time decision. Hope for some clarity before locking in your lineups because if McLaurin's deemed healthy enough to play, he's in a good spot against a vulnerable Eagles secondary.","Engram had already posted his second-most productive game of the season when he was forced out of Week 16's contest in the fourth quarter due to an ankle injury. To that point, he had caught seven passes for 65 yards. His status entering Week 17's crucial date with the Cowboys is unclear, but the club is optimistic he'll play. If he does, he's in the fantasy mix as a low-end TE1.","A recent surge in playmaking has resulted in Brown producing a touchdown in four of the past five games with 98 yards in the one scoreless outing during this stretch. Brown tallied a season-best fantasy performance against the Bengals back in Week 5, setting him up as a worthy flex candidate this week.","The Bears D/ST did not disappoint in a prime matchup with the Jaguars last week, but may struggle to produce starter-worthy numbers against the red-hot Packers, who are playing for the No. 1 seed and a bye week. Avoid this D/ST due to the very tough Week 17 opponent.","A true target hog whenever healthy, Johnson paced Pittsburgh with 14 attempts sent his way this past Sunday. While more yardage on such heavy volume would be nice, it's still helpful that Johnson is such a key part of the offense. Shifting to the team's backup quarterback limits Johnson's fantasy value this week, but he's still a fine option in PPR formats given Cleveland's struggles against the pass.","A neck injury has kept Johnson off the field for the past two weeks, creating some doubt for his availability this week against the Titans. Even if active, Johnson is unlikely to prove very busy given his injury concerns and the success David Johnson has enjoyed of late. ","This rookie speedster has endured a small share of the targets this season and too often serves as a vertical decoy, of sorts. Even with Denver's secondary dealing with some injuries, Ruggs isn't a viable fantasy starter.",null,null,"Cousins delivered a solid outing against the Saints in Week 16, giving him a good bit of momentum heading into a great matchup (albeit in a meaningless game) against the Lions to finish out the season. If you trust him to play the whole game, he's a great option against a defense allowing 21-plus points per game to opposing passers."],"7":[null,"Finally, all that volume paid off. Fantasy managers who stuck with Drake through five pedestrian outings were rewarded in Week 6 with 164 yards and a pair of touchdowns against the Cowboys. When a running back is getting an average of around 17 carries per game, he's a \"must start\" in fantasy -- and Monday was proof as to why. Keep him locked in as a starter in all leagues for Week 7 against the Seahawks.","The Bears won, but Robinson had a disappointing outing in Week 6. He hauled in only five passes on nine targets for 53 yards and has been held to a maximum of five catches and 75 yards three times already this season. A matchup with an impressive Rams pass defense is up next, so while Robinson still gets enough volume to merit a start in every league, expectations should be lowered.","Johnson already has more rushing yards and touchdowns than he did in all of 2019. He's compiled such solid numbers thanks to a busy role out of Houston's backfield, with Duke Johnson only rarely playing a real role. With David Johnson set for around 20 touches against a Packers defense that has allowed the most fantasy points to backs, he's in a solid spot to meet his projection. ","An illness kept Gordon from seeing the field this past week, leaving Phillip Lindsay to handle a big workload. Likely back at the lead of the Denver backfield this week, especially in high-value goal-line scenarios, it helps Gordon's case as a flex option that the Chiefs have allowed 4.7 yards per carry to tailbacks on the year.

Even as Tennessee has a defensive identity, the secondary has allowed 198.9 yards per game to receivers, setting up Johnson with the potential to deliver flex value in this matchup.","Sent just two targets and eight routes while David Johnson proved really busy in Week 6, Johnson Jr. simply doesn't have a real share of this offense. ","Capable of converting a few opportunities into big numbers, such as his 118 yards on just two catches in Week 5, Ruggs also possesses a low floor given a relatively light workload. As the resident vertical threat for the Raiders, there is always some upside present with Ruggs, yet he's not a reliable fantasy option given Tampa Bay's back seven has allowed the seventh-fewest fantasy points per game to

2019 NFL MVP is fresh off a breakout season in which he outscored the next-closest quarterback by 78 fantasy points despite resting in Week 17. The dual-threat weapon threw 36 touchdowns to only six interceptions while adding a record-setting 176-1,206-7 rushing line -- that rushing production alone would've ranked 28th among running backs. The question is: Can he do it again? History says no, as his 9.0% TD rate (highest the NFL has seen over the past decade) is unsustainable, and the last quarterback to repeat as the top-scoring fantasy QB was Daunte Culpepper in 2004. On the other hand, Jackson's rushing volume and prowess give him an extremely high floor, as shown by his 11 top-six fantasy weeks in 15 outings last season. Jackson's unique style makes him an elite fantasy weapon and worth a look early in Round 3.","Drake received the transition tag from the Cardinals during the offseason and will return as the team's clear feature back. Traded from Miami to Arizona at the 2019 trade deadline, Drake went on to play 381 (79%) of 483 possible snaps during his eight games with the team. He handled 66% of the team's carries (15.4 per game) and 14% of the targets (4.4) during that span. That heavy usage allowed him the fourth-most fantasy points among RBs during that span. Arizona's offense should only improve in Kliff Kingsbury and Kyler Murray's second season, so Drake, who sports an impressive 4.8 career YPC, is very much in the RB1 discussion.","It took a while following a lost 2017 due to a torn ACL and a transition to Chicago in 2018, but Robinson has finally reestablished himself as one of the game's top receivers. Last season, Robinson paced all wide receivers in snaps while ranking no lower than sixth in routes, targets, receptions and end-zone targets. A lack of post-catch production (2.6 RAC) limited Robinson's yardage, but he still managed his second career top-eight fantasy campaign. Robinson enters his age-27 season without a reliable quarterback, but he is in his prime with a generous target share. Consider him to be a solid WR2.","Johnson was one of the league's best backs during his first two seasons, but struggles with injuries and efficiency led to a benching last season and was followed by an offseason trade to Houston. The 28-year-old is well-positioned for a rebound campaign with passing-down specialist Duke Johnson as his only competition for touches. The question is: Is he up for it? Johnson averaged an ugly 3.6 YPC and 1.4 YAC during the past three seasons. He remains an effective receiver but figures to focus primarily on rushing the ball with Duke Johnson in the picture. Johnson can't be counted on as an elite fantasy asset, but he has a path to enough volume to allow midrange RB2 production.","Gordon signed on as the Broncos' new lead back, following five seasons with the Chargers. Gordon is fresh off a season when he held out for a month before posting 162-612-8 rushing and 42-296-1 receiving lines. That was enough for the 12th-most fantasy points during that span. Gordon entered 2019 having finished the previous three seasons no lower than ninth in scrimmage yards, sixth in touchdowns and eighth in fantasy points among backs. In Denver's run-heavy offense, Gordon figures to share a chunk of the carries with Phillip Lindsay, but his bigger frame should garner him more goal-line work, and he's also the superior receiver. Gordon is a mid-to-back end RB2.","Washington drafted McLaurin in the second round of the 2019 draft and it took the Ohio State product just one game to solidify himself as the team's top offensive weapon. McLaurin went on to miss a pair of games due to injury, but ranked 17th in fantasy points during the 14 weeks in which he was active. McLaurin was a bit over his head in the touchdown department (7 TD, 5.8 OTD), but saw a healthy 10 end-zone targets (11th most in the NFL) and his 10.0 YPT was ninth best. The 24-year-old is second-year QB Dwayne Haskins' go-to target and a fringe WR2 in fantasy.","Engram is entering his fourth NFL season having missed 14 of 48 possible games due to injury, including five games in 2018 and eight last season. The injuries have held Engram without a top-12 fantasy campaign since 2017, but there's no doubt he's been a major force when healthy. Engram was one of six players who appeared in at least eight games and were targeted at least six times during 100% of those outings last season. The consistent usage helped him to five top-10 fantasy weeks in eight tries (the position's fourth-best rate). We have to knock him a bit for durability concerns, but Engram is still in his prime at age 25 and should be locked into lineups when active.","Baltimore selected Brown in the first round of the 2019 draft and the speedster was immediately slotted in as the team's top wide receiver by default. Brown's boom/bust rookie campaign began with his best game in Week 1 (4-147-2) followed by mixed results (including a pair of missed games) the rest of the way. Brown ended up as the WR46 on the season, thanks to seven touchdowns on 69 targets. His 10.1% TD rate was second highest at the position and certainly unsustainable. Brown is an obvious bet for a boost in targets in his second season as Lamar Jackson's top perimeter target. The 23-year-old is a breakout candidate and a sharp flex target.","One season after dominating the NFL with 55 more fantasy points than any other D/ST, Chicago plummeted to 15th in 2019. The Bears fell from a league-high 11 top-10 fantasy weeks in 2018 to three (24th) in 2019. Chicago was still solid in terms of yardage (eighth) and points (fifth) allowed, but plummeted from first to 22nd in forced turnovers and third to 24th in sacks. On the plus side, impact KR Cordarrelle Patterson scored his fifth return touchdown in as many seasons. The Bears lost three of their top six and seven of their top 12 defenders in terms of snaps during the offseason, including Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, Leonard Floyd and Prince Amukamara. The addition of Robert Quinn and return of Akiem Hicks will help, but, even with the likes of Khalil Mack, Eddie Jackson, Danny Trevathan and Kyle Fuller, this unit isn't nearly as intimidating as it was in 2018. Consider it a back-end starting option.","All things considered, Johnson had a pretty darn impressive rookie season. The 2019 third-round pick was a part-time player for most of the season, but still managed a solid 59-680-5 receiving line on his way to a 39th-place finish in fantasy points. That success came despite his operating in an offense with extremely poor quarterback play. That's unlikely to be an issue again in 2020 with Ben Roethlisberger back from injury. Johnson joins up with JuJu Smith-Schuster, James Washington and rookie Chase Claypool to form one of the league's top young WR groups. Roethlisberger has supported three fantasy-relevant WRs in the past, so it's certainly possible for multiple receivers to shine in Pittsburgh's pass-heavy offense. Consider Johnson as a flex target with upside.","After spending 2019 as a passing-down complement to Carlos Hyde, Johnson is expected to play a similar role behind newcomer David Johnson this season. Johnson has yet to convince a coaching staff that he's worthy of a three-down role, as he has managed only 76 carries per season since entering the league in 2015. Although his targets have dipped the past two seasons, Johnson has been in the upper two thirds in yards per target all five seasons, and his 4.1 OTD (expected TD total) paced the position last season. Johnson's role severely limits his ceiling, and it's possible that he will lose targets to David Johnson this season. Consider the 26-year-old a weak flex in PPR leagues.","The Raiders have a history of targeting speed at wide receivers, so it was no surprise when they selected Ruggs (4.27 40-yard dash) with the 12th pick of April's draft. The 5-foot-11, 188-pound playmaker has great hands, ball skills and is exceptional after the catch. The Alabama product was limited to 55 targets in 2019, but his 13.6 YPT and 10.5 RAC were both top four in this year's rookie class. Ruggs figures to operate as a perimeter lid-lifter and returner in the pros, which would be good news in the explosive-play department, but it could cap his target upside. That said, the Raiders have such a severe need at wideout that Ruggs is very likely to step right into an every-down role. The Raiders' new No. 1 wide receiver is a borderline flex in 2020 leagues.","Gould is back with the NFC Champion 49ers after a 2019 campaign that saw him stumble to 17th in fantasy points. That was quite the step back for a player who had finished his previous three full seasons as a top-seven fantasy kicker. It's fair to wonder if age is becoming a factor for the 37-year-old, as last season's 74.2% field goal percentage was the worst of his career, though perhaps it was a fluke after he paced the league at 96.5% over the previous three seasons. Despite the down year, Gould should be viewed as a solid fantasy starter in a Niners' offense that has ranked no lower than seventh in field goal attempts in each of the past three seasons.","","Cousins may be conservative, but there's no denying he was one of the league's most effective passers last season. The eight-year vet completed 69% of his passes (top-5 for the second consecutive season) and posted an 8.1 YPA (seventh best). Despite the efficiency, Cousins was not a good fantasy QB. Minnesota's run-heavy offense was problematic, as he posted one weekly finish better than sixth and was outside the top 20 in eight of 15 starts. Cousins hasn't used his legs as often in Minnesota as he did in Washington, which has been a factor in his 12th-   and 15th-place finishes among QBs in fantasy during the past two seasons.

Broncos were solid against the run last season in surrendering just 4.0 yards per carry to opposing backfields, but their front seven faces a serious challenge with the bruising Henry. Leading the league in rushing by nearly 200 yards last season and with some preseason talk of him getting more work as a receiver fuels RB1 status for Henry heading into this prime-time conference meeting.","Jones fell six yards shy of his sixth straight 1,400-yard season in 2019 and enters 2020 seemingly healthy and ready to go. He's never quite scored as many touchdowns as fantasy managers might be hoping for, but that hasn't stopped him from being a dominant fantasy option on a weekly basis. Against a middling Seattle pass defense, Jones is a must-start WR1 in Week 1.","A breakout 2019 effort saw Andrews overcome a modest snap rate by consuming a dominant share of the Baltimore passing offense. Now that there is less competition for snaps and routes with Hayden Hurst down in Atlanta, Andrews is positioned as a solid starting fantasy force heading into this opening matchup with a Cleveland team that allowed tight ends to haul in 68% of their targets last season.","Woods was a difficult player to assess in fantasy last year, hauling in 90 passes for over 1,100 yards but only finding the end zone three times -- and just twice as a receiver. With Brandin Cooks no longer on the team, he and Cooper Kupp will be Jared Goff's top two wideouts, but the emergence of the tight end in the Los Angeles offense might limit the TD upside for Woods. Still, the consistency of an 80-catch, 1,000-yard receiver is worth a spot in your lineups most weeks, including Week 1 against Dallas.","A glaringly inefficient 2019 saw Bell struggle as both a rusher and receiver, but netting 311 touches helped offset such issues. Focusing on his potential in this first matchup of 2020, the Bills weren't stellar against the run in regards to yardage allowance to opposing backfields, but they did yield just the 10th-fewest scores to backs. Assuming Bell nets a big workload, he's somewhere in the RB2 or flex range among backs for this division matchup.","Are you used to seeing Brady's name without \"New England\" or \"Patriots\" next to it yet? The veteran has joined the Buccaneers and should pick up right where he left off as a capable, efficient passer who lacks a bit of upside, given his age. The New Orleans pass defense is nothing to be too concerned with, so lock in Brady as your starting passer for Week 1.","An incredible finish to the season saw Parker finish as a top 12 fantasy producer in 2019. With more competition for targets from his positional peers and with a brutal first matchup against the league's top pass defense from last season, Parker is best considered a flex play to open the campaign.","As it stands, Cohen is on top of the Bears' RB depth chart for Week 1, with second-year back David Montgomery looking likely to miss action due to a groin injury. However, Cohen is not an every-down back and should see little by way of a boost if his teammate is indeed sidelined. Cohen had more receptions than carries a year ago, and that's why you want him on your fantasy team -- especially in PPR formats. He's got a low ceiling but a fairly high floor and merits consideration as an RB2/flex in most leagues against a lackluster Detroit defense.","With a fantasy-friendly role over the past several seasons that proves ideal for PPR formats, White's statistical floor isn't quite as stable now that Tom Brady is in Florida. Then again, Cam Newton successfully fed a famous PPR maven in Carolina for several seasons, so there is some potential for this transition to prove smooth. The Dolphins allowed nearly nine yards per reception to backs last season, well above league average, helping White's case as a flex option for the opener.","While Gardner Minshew avoided turnovers in the passing phase last season, there is some big-play potential for this Colts D/ST facing a green quarterback at the helm of a shallow offense. The Colts were banged up on defense last season, but figure to enter the campaign at full force.","Kirk didn't exactly \"break out\" in Year 2, but he picked up more work as a receiver and posted career-highs across the board. As Larry Fitzgerald gets even closer to riding off into retirement, Kirk should grow into a solid role as the No. 2 receiver behind DeAndre Hopkins. For now, though, with all three receivers in the lineup and a great pass-catching back in Kenyan Drake, it's hard to trust Kirk as anything more than a flex option, given so much competition for targets.","Jones provided surprisingly good numbers at times in 2019, averaging over 22 points per contest -- with a nice chunk of rushing production to provide a floor for his passing efforts. However, he'll face Pittsburgh (a top-10 pass defense from last season) in Week 1. If you have other options, you might want to consider them in this instance.","An injury to Trey Burton means Doyle could be on the field a lot for the Colts to open the season. The Jaguars were respectable in defending tight ends in 2019, but a volume of snaps and targets could help Doyle flirt with fantasy relevance this week.",null,"Seemingly healthy for the first time in his pro career, this Ohio State product makes for a solid sleeper option now that Philip Rivers brings some needed consistency to the Colts' passing game. Not yet trustworthy for fantasy purposes given his lack of track record, Campbell is a nice depth option heading into this division meeting with a soft Jacksonville defense.","Gibson's rise to stardom is straight out of a movie script, as the unheralded small-school back transferred to Memphis, made big plays and earned a spot on an NFL roster. He then played his way into what looks like a starting role to begin his rookie season. He'll face the Eagles in his first pro game -- a team stout against the run. To say Gibson lacks experience is an understatement, so consider him as no more than a flex flier for your Week 1 lineups."],"2":["Delivering his league-leading seventh 100-yard rushing performance since the start of last season, Henry handled an astounding 34 touches in the rousing win over the Broncos this past Monday. The Jaguars coughed up gobs of scrimmage yardage to the Colts' backfield in Week 1, aiding Henry's case as arguably the best play at the position this week.","Jones led the league in receiving yards during Week 1 with 157 yards on nine catches (12 targets), though he didn't find the end zone. This week, he faces a Cowboys secondary which lost two of last season's starters to free agency, including top CB Brian Jones who would have drawn coverage here. Jones is matchup proof, with a solid chance to be among the league leaders in receiving yards again this week.","In just his third NFL appearance with at least 42 snaps, Andrews thrived as the unquestioned lead tight end after serving in more of a committee approach last year. You can't expect multi-score outings each week from Andrews, but facing a weaker Houston back seven that has allowed the most yards per game to tight ends since Week 10 of last year results in a healthy projection.","Woods came out ahead of Cooper Kupp in Week 1, hauling in more passes and seeing more targets than his fellow top wideout. This situation will be rather unpredictable all season long, but both players are usually solid starting options given their combined share of the Los Angeles passing game. That remains true in Week 2 against an Eagles defense that struggled against receivers a year ago.","Held to only 2.3 YPC on his first six rushing attempts this past Sunday before going down with a hamstring ailment, Bell continued on last year's trend that saw him finish with the fewest yards per carry among backs with 200 totes. It's not clear how long Bell might need to get back from this hamstring issue, so managers will want to identify other options if he's not available for this unsavory matchup with the 49ers. ","Fans of both the Patriots and Buccaneers flashed back to last season as Brady was intercepted twice, including a pick-six. He did rush for one score and threw for another as part of his 239-yard day in the air. The veteran has been written off several times, only to rebound each time with a vengeance. Look, he deserves the benefit of the doubt in Week 2, especially when taking on a beatable Panthers defense in what will be the Buccaneers' home opener.","Hauling in all four of his targets for 47 yards before leaving with the dreaded hamstring injury, Parker looked good when available. Availability is a key factor for Parker's fantasy profile this week, but it's also worth noting the Bills present a very tough matchup in the secondary. Adding up the risk factors, Parker's managers will want to have some strong alternatives prepared.","Cohen saw 50% of the RB snaps in Week 1, but opportunities were few and far between. That's the risk with Cohen, who is a passing-game specialist that plays alongside David Montgomery, who is the one who gets all of the carries. The Giants don't have a great pass defense, so Cohen is worth a shot as a flex in most leagues. Still, you may have safer options with more upside to use in that spot.","Limited to 10 touches, White was at least a factor in the passing phase in what was the Cam Newton show for the Patriots. An uptick in passing work would be nice for this flex option in PPR formats -- which is possible in a game that could demand more offensive diversity against the Seahawks.","The Colts produced the third-highest pressure rate in the league in Week 1, only it didn't really seem to bother Gardner Minshew II's wily performance. Without many established big play elements on this defense and Minnesota's seemingly conservative offense up next, you can find stronger streaming candidates than the Colts.  ","Kirk couldn't find his rhythm in Week 1, catching only one of his five targets and failing to even pick up a yard on his lone reception. That said, five targets was still good enough for a three-way tie for second on the Arizona offense, which is about where we expected Kirk to be heading into the season. He's still a flex option, albiet a low-ceiling one, heading into Week 2 against a Washington defense that looks to be improved, though not unbeatable.","In Week 1, Jones picked up right where he left off last season, mixing flashes of strong play with untimely mistakes, ultimately finishing with 279 passing yards, a pair of touchdowns, and two costly picks. Granted, Jones did draw the tough Steelers defense in Week 1, but the poor decisions were on him. Even though Jones faces a less fierce Bears unit this week, look for Saquon Barkley to shine. Leave Jones on the fantasy bench.","A 28-yard catch-and-run play helped fuel a respectable first showing for this streaming candidate among tight ends. The Colts spread the ball around a good deal and the Vikings have been stingy against tight ends dating back to last season, factors further limiting the appeal for Doyle.",null,"The Ohio State product led the team in routes and tied for the lead in targets in a strong opening outing. It was good to see Campbell run 58 of his 62 snaps from the slot, per Pro Football Focus, evidence he could enjoy advantageous matchups -- including this week against the Vikings -- going forward.","The rookie impressed in his NFL debut, leading Washington in rushing. He had 36 yards on nine carries, while also catching a pair of throws for another eight yards. Gibsonâ€™s six-foot, 228-pound frame shows potential for heavy usage but, for now, his touches will be limited. Those in keeper and dynasty leagues should be excited. Just donâ€™t expect much early this season, including in Week 2. Heâ€™s a bye-week stash, at best."],"3":["Scoreless through two appearances despite gobs of touches, Henry's 84 rushing yards in Week 2 marked his fewest since Week 9 of last season. Due for some scoring success as the engine of the Tennessee ground game, Henry should thrive during a matchup with a Vikings defense allowing 140 rushing yards per game to backs this season.","After an outstanding opening week, Jones was hampered with a sore hamstring in last week's last-second loss to the Cowboys, catching two balls for just 24 yards. The Bears' pass defense is tough on wideouts so it may be another week before Jones finds the end zone for the first time this season. With a week to heal and a history of playing through injuries, Jones remains a must-start, though it's worth monitoring practice reports, especially late in the week.","Lamar Jackson didn't push the ball outside in Week 2 and instead kept the ball underneath in a conservative showing. Andrews was limited to just one haul, but is expected to prove busy in a higher-scoring affair with the Chiefs. Kansas City has been solid in coverage, but volume and red zone attention both work in Andrews' favor.","Woods took a step back in Week 2 as a receiver, hauling in only 14 yards worth of passes. He did, however, score a rushing touchdown to salvage a decent day from a fantasy perspective. Still, the Rams offense is not running at maximum efficiency and the Bills have a solid pass defense. Consider Woods as more of a WR2 option for the week ahead.","Placed on injured reserve with a hamstring injury, we won't be seeing Bell for several weeks.","Brady's second game in a Buccaneers uniform resulted in a victory, though his performance was just so-so. He threw for 217 yards with a touchdown and another pick. In his defense, Brady was without Chris Godwin and Mike Evans was coming off a week where he was hobbled with a sore hamstring. This week, Brady is a borderline QB1 as he'll square off with a Denver defense that's a far cry from its championship days.","It was encouraging that amid injury concerns that Parker played on a team-high 43 routes in Week 2, helping lead to his touchdown. The Jaguars aren't particularly stingy on the outside, helping Parker's bid as a WR3 this week.","Cohen's volume has been concering to start the season, as he's received only 12 carries and three targets after two games. David Montgomery is getting more and more involved in the Bears passing game, which eliminates one of Cohen's biggest strengths. Meanwhile, Cordarrelle Patterson has stepped into a bigger role as a runner and seems to be directly cutting into Cohen's opportunities. Keep Cohen on the bench, even against a poor Atlanta defense in Week 3.","Some devastating personal news saw White sit out Week 2. If he's active for this looming matchup with the Raiders, it helps White's case that the Raiders' front seven struggles in coverage.","The Colts held Kirk Cousins to the worst completion rate (42%) and most interceptions (three) of his Vikings career. With some real momentum as a pass defense, the Colts next face a struggling Jets offense that has yet to take flight.","Kirk saw fewer targets and played on fewer snaps than veteran Larry Fitzgerald in Week 2, which is a major issue for those relying on Kirk as a starting wideout in fantasy. If he's truly splitting work with Fitzgerald behind fantasy superstar DeAndre Hopkins, that likely leaves both as risky flex picks every week. Against the Lions' porous pass defense, consisder Kirk no more than a low-end WR3/flex option.","Jones will be asked to step up with Saquon Barkley out for the season. The second-year signal-caller rallied the Giants from a 17-0 halftime deficit to  fall just short of beating the Bears in a narrow 17-13 loss. Even so, Jones has a tall task this week, facing a stingy 49ers defense. If Jones is your fantasy backup, it could be time to look for an upgrade.","Knee and ankle injuries held Doyle out of Week 2, which saw positional peer Mo Alie-Cox erupt with a career performance. If Doyle can go this week, facing a depleted Jets back seven is an inviting matchup. With Alie-Cox on the rise, however, Doyle is likely more of a TE2 than an actual streaming option.",null,"Campbell had to be carted off the field after he suffered a left knee injury in the first quarter in Week 2. A PCL injury figures to sideline Campbell indefinitely, with rookie Michael Pittman Jr. as a clear beneficiary.","In his second game as a pro, Gibson scampered for 55 yards on 13 totes, including his first career touchdown. After finishing with the fewest snaps among the backfield corps in the opening week, Gibson led all backs in Week 2. The increased volume will help this week as Washington faces a Browns defense allowing the third-fewest yards on the ground. Gibson should be considered as a flex candidate for Week 3."],"4":["This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","Jones was inactive with a sore hamstring for last week's game with the Bears. He was, however, a game-time decision which lends hope he can return Monday night against the Packers in what should be a high-scoring affair. Monitor injury reports, as an extra day to heal could help Jones. However, that also puts his fantasy teams in a bind if he can't go.","Close to a much bigger game this past Monday with a few missed connections down the seam and in the red zone. Andrews' rough Week 3 seems more like an outlier than trend. The Washington Football Team, meanwhile, has allowed just over 57 yards per game to tight ends, setting up Andrews for a solid showing.","Woods and Cooper Kupp continue to lead the way at receiver for the Rams -- and both provided start-worthy stat lines in Week 3. The Giants have been decent against the pass so far this season, but have still allowed the 13th-most WR fantasy points, giving both Woods and Kupp room to be stars in Week 4. Consider Woods to be a solid WR2/flex pick.",null,"Buoyed by a pair of one-yard scoring strikes to Mike Evans, in Week 3 Brady posted his best game with the Buccaneers, throwing for 297 yards and three touchdowns. A repeat will be a tall task as next up is a Chargers defense giving up the eighth-fewest aerial yards (with just three touchdowns). The potential momnetum is certainly encouraging, but Brady remains a matchup play. As such, this isn't the week to deploy the veteran.","The Dolphins didn't have to drop back very often in Week 3, but it does prove promising for his durability that Parker was able to lead the team in routes run. Seattle has allowed more fantasy points to receivers than any other team by a wide margin, supporting WR3 value for Parker in Week 4.","The Bears have placed Cohen on season-ending injured reserve due to a torn ACL he suffered in Week 3.","Still away from the team with a personal matter, White would resume his valuable role as the team's top receiving threat out of the backfield and with real red zone pedigree. The Chiefs have struggled to contain backs this season, with White positioned as a solid flex if he's active.","The Colts scored two defensive scores in a game for the first time since 2014 and as a franchise had just two pick-sixes in the prior four seasons. The Colts next face a surging Chicago offense with Nick Foles, but given Indy's 34.8% pressure rate, which is third-highest, this D/ST remains in the starting mix.","Kirk sat out the Cardinals' Week 3 contest against Detroit, and his status for Week 4 is up in the air. Should he return, he'll rejoin a WR unit that is very top-heavy, with DeAndre Hopkins leading the NFL in targets. No other wideout seems to have a consistent handle on the volume needed to be a fantasy starter. Look elsewhere for Week 4.","After throwing twice as many touchdowns as picks in his rookie campaign, Jones has flipped the script with just two scores and four interceptions through three games of 2020. Being without Saquon Barkley and Sterling Shepard obviously hurt him in Week 3 and will continue to be a big barrier this week against the Rams. Jones could have some success running the ball in Week 4, but his passing numbers project to fall well short of what's needed for a fantasy start.","We've learned that managers can't trust Doyle as a starting fantasy option now that he's competing with Moe Alie-Cox for meaningful targets. Simply put, there just isn't room in this offense to support two tight ends, especially in a tough matchup with Chicago.",null,null,"Despite trailing J.D. McKissic in snaps, Gibson was more productive in Week 3, tallying 60 yards from scrimmage on a dozen touches, including one for a rushing score. In Week 4, Gibson will face the toughest test of his rookie season in a road affair with the Ravens. With the difficult matchup, Gibson sets up as no more than a flex."],"5":["Henry has averaged nearly 30 touches per game as the offensive engine for Tennessee this season. The Bills have yielded the ninth-fewest fantasy points and just 83 rushing yards per game to backfields, and yet Henry's amazing workload supports RB1 expectations.","Jones left Monday night's contest late in the second quarter after re-injuring his hamstring that kept him out of Week 3 action. He was unable to return for the second half and remains questionable for this week's home encounter with Carolina. Jones has gritted out injuries before, so if the Falcons see fit to have him active, so should you.","Turning three targets into two touchdowns and nearly 60 yards was quite the feat of efficiency from Andrews this past week. Now third in team history in multi-score games, Andrews should thrive against a generous Cincinnati defense allowing 65 receiving yards per game to tight ends.","Woods couldn't get anything going in the yardage department in Week 4 against the Giants, but still had an encouraging seven passes thrown his way. If that volume continues, he'll remain a solid WR2 most weeks, even against a Washington team allowing the second-fewest WR fantasy points.","Bell could find himself activated and starting for Week 5 against the Cardinals, a team allowing more than the average points per game to opposing backs this season. Assuming his injury status is clear and he's not on any snap counts or time limits, the dynamic back should step back into a fantasy-friendly role in a Jets offense lacking in great options in either the running or passing games. Consider him as an RB2 if he returns to action without limits.","In Week 4, Brady harkened back to his salad days, completing 30 passes in 46 attempts for 369 yards and five scoring strikes. It was his best game yet with the Buccaneers, with most of the damage coming in the second half as Tampa Bay rallied from a 10-point deficit to win 38-31. The Bears should provide a lot more resistance this week as their defense has allowed the third-fewest passing yards per game with only three total touchdowns. Brady is a borderline QB1, though he might be without his top two wideouts. That could drop him from Week 5 fantasy consideration.","Enjoying a solid start to the season with a stellar catch rate of 83%, Parker saw a dozen targets this past week on his way to another big line. A tougher secondary awaits this week with San Francisco allowing just the eighth-fewest fantasy points to receivers, yet Parker's big slice of the offensive pie keeps him in the WR2 discussion.",null,"The game between the Patriots and the Broncos has been postponed. Both teams will be on a bye for Week 5.","The Colts' offense is still a work in progress, but their defense has been relatively great. Ranked eighth in sack rate and allowing the fewest yards per dropback to opposing quarterbacks, the Colts just flexed elite rush defense in holding the Bears to 28 rushing yards, their fewest in a year. The Browns have scored at least 30 points in three straight and possess a strong rushing game, but it's understandable to trust this defense to overcome the matchup.","In Week 4, Kirk returned to the field after a one-week absence and delivered a lackluster outing, hauling in 3-of-5 targets but managing a touchdown to salvage an otherwise poor day on the field from a fantasy perspective. That's going to be the reality for Arizona most weeks, with Larry Fitzgerald and Andy Isabella combining with Kenyan Drake to divide the targets not going to top wideout DeAndre Hopkins. With that in mind, against a middling Jets pass defense, Kirk is a non-starter in fantasy for Week 5.","Week 4 was a rough one for the second-year signal caller as Jones connected on just 23-of-36 passes for 190 yards, a paltry 5.3 yards per attempt. The Rams pressured Jones all game, sacking him five times. Week 5 is one of the few chances for him to be fantasy viable as a QB streaming option. Jones will face a Cowboys defense that was just picked apart by Baker Mayfield last week.","Sent just 20 air yards on two targets, Doyle was a minor contributor to the Colts' game plan in Week 4. Now that the team is deploying three tight ends regularly in the passing phase, Doyle isn't on the radar for this meeting with an exploitable Cleveland back seven.",null,null,"Gibson and wideout Terry McLaurin represent beacons of light in a Washington offense otherwise devoid of fantasy goodness. Last week, Gibson ran for 46 yards with a touchdown on 13 carries, adding a robust 82 receiving yards on four catches. Gibson's presence as a backfield receiver could come in handy facing a Rams defense allowing the tenth-most RB receiving yards per game. The rookie merits RB2/flex consideration for this week's home affair with Los Angeles."],"6":["An obvious favorite to lead the league in total touches, Henry continues to grind out solid fantasy showings with each herculean workload. This week's divisional showdown with Houston looks quite appealing for Henry given the Texans have allowed 5.2 yards per carry to tailbacks, fifth-most in the league. After another two scores in Week 5, Henry is a top option at his position in Week 6.","Jones wasn't able to suit up last week against the Panthers after aggravating his hamstring injury the previous game. He's questionable for this week's encounter with the Vikings, though the fact he was a game-time decision in Week 5 lends hope he'll indeed be ready. A healthy Jones is an automatic start but, even at less than 100%, if he's active against the weak Vikings secondary, it would take you having a very deep WR corps to keep him out of your fantasy lineup.","Both Marquise Brown and Andrews enjoyed rewarding 27% target shares this past Sunday. Even as the receiving pie can prove small some weeks given Baltimore's propensity to run, Andrews' consistently valuable share of total targets and red zone looks aids his case as a top fantasy option. It also helps Andrews' fantasy profile this week that the Eagles have allowed a generous 18.6 fantasy points per game to tight ends on the year, fourth most in the league.","Woods has been inconsistent in his fantasy production this season, but he did manage to find the end zone on a 56-yard pass in Week 5 to provide a solid output for those that started him. San Francisco looked very vulnerable through the air last week against Miami, and Woods remains one of the top options in the Los Angeles offense. Lock him in as a solid WR2 pick for Week 6.","Bell returned to action in Week 5, racking up 67 yards from scrimmage on 14 touches, but was released by the Jets just a couple days later. He has agreed to sign with the Chiefs, but because he has to undergo five days of COVID-19 testing, he will not be available to join the team in time for Monday's game. Check back in Week 7.","After exploding in Week 4 against the Chargers, Brady reverted to a more pedestrian level in Week 5 with a 25-for-41 effort (253 yards, 1 TD) against the Bears in a 20-19 loss. The veteran will get 10 days to recover from his mental mistake on the last play of the game, when he forgot it was fourth down. With the extra time to prepare for an average Packers defense, Brady checks in as a low-end QB1 this week.","Despite leading the Dolphins with 30 routes run this past week in San Francisco, Parker curiously saw just three targets sent his way in the big win. Thankfully, one of them was good for a touchdown. With the potential for an uptick in targets against the Jets' suspect secondary, Parker is a fine flex option.",null,"A very White-like performance in Week 4 saw him sit second on the team in targets while compiling nearly 60 scrimmage yards. Fully back into the offensive mix after missing a few games, White should see around a dozen touches and valuable receiving work as a high-floor flex against Denver this week.","With at least six fantasy points in every game and double-digit fantasy production in three showings already, this D/ST is among the more consistently productive units in the league. Next up is a savory setup against a rookie passer and the Bengals' inefficient offense.","Kirk had his best showing of the season in Week 5, seeing his best target and yardage totals in a win over the Jets. He's proven to be somewhat inconsistent this season as he battles for volume with Larry Fitzgerald, Chase Edmond and others behind DeAndre Hopkins in the passing game. Still, an upward trajectory against a porous Dallas defense means he's a flex consideration in deeper leagues for Week 6.","Jones' on-the-job training continues as his streak of games without connecting for a score reached four in Week 5's loss to the Cowboys. It not all Jones' fault, as the loss of Saquon Barkley certainly hasn't helped matters. That said, even when the star running back was in the New York huddle, Jones didn't loom to be \"fantasy ready.\" Look for Washington to keep the sophomore under pressure like Dallas did last week.","Allocated just two targets against the Browns this past week, Doyle didn't catch either of them in yet another forgettable fantasy showing. Trey Burton earned more routes and targets in the game, signaling a waning receiving role for this veteran. The Bengals have been weak against tight ends in most matchups, although Doyle is unlikely to be a factor.",null,null,"Gibson may not be lighting it up, but he is progressing -- and rewarding those who took a late-round chance on the rookie. Most noteworthy is Gibson's involvement in the Washington passing game, reeling in all five of his Week 5 targets for 24 yards, to go along with 11 carries for 27 yards. Gibson will look to continue his improvement against a league-average Giants defense. As the clear No. 1 back in his huddle, Gibson profiles as an RB2 for Week 6."],"7":["With a career-high 264 scrimmage yards in the overtime win over the Texans this past Sunday, Henry incredibly joined Jim Brown, Barry Sanders and LaDainian Tomlinson as the only players in NFL history with three career games with at least 200 rushing yards and two rushing scores. With an elite Pittsburgh defense coming to town, this game features arguably the league's best rusher against the league's toughest front seven. If any tailback up for such a challenge, it's Henry.","Despite practicing on a limited basis heading into last Sunday's tilt with the Vikings, Jones exhibited no ill effects from the hamstring injury that had allowed him to see the field for just the first half of Week 4.

Jones is set up for another big game against a depleted Lions secondary.",null,"Woods had a season-high 10 passes thrown his way against the 49ers on Sunday, hauling in his third TD pass to salvage an otherwise lackluster performance. Still, Woods and teammate Cooper Kupp continue to get the volume needed to earn a spot in most fantasy lineups moving forward. A tough matchup against Chicago (third-fewest WR fantasy points per game this year) looms, but Woods is good enough to start as a WR3/flex in most leagues.","How many touches will Bell earn in his debut? If you know, please share. But really, we'll need to see just how Bell is deployed in his debut before really gauging his fantasy stock wearing red. This first matchup is a real challenge, as the Broncos have surrendered the third-fewest fantasy points to backfields on the year.","Brady didn't need to air it out much in Week 6's surprisingly lopsided 38-10 victory over the Packers as he attempted just 27 passes, completing 17 of them for 166 yards and two touchdowns. Next on the docket is a Raiders defense allowing the eighth-most passing yards-per-game while registering the fifth-fewest average sacks per contest. Still dangerous with time to throw, Brady is a solid start in Las Vegas.",null,null,"With at least 10 touches in consecutive outings and a stellar 26% target share with Cam Newton at the helm, White is once again a flex candidate in PPR formats. The ceiling is likely low for White in this difficult matchup with a 49ers defense allowing just 29 receiving yards per game, fourth fewest in the NFL.",null,"Kirk made a huge impact on Monday against Dallas despite limited volume, catching a pair of TD passes on only three targets. Kirk is a bit of an all-or-nothing receiver thanks to his inconsistent target share in the Arizona offense, but he has more than enough talent to make the most of even limited opportunities. Against a Seattle team allowing a ton of points to opposing wideouts, Kirk is a high-ceiling, low-floor flex pick for Week 7.","Jones didn't do much in Week 6, but it was enough to engineer a 20-19 victory over Washington. The sophomore signal caller passed for only 112 yards, completing 12-of-19 throws for a touchdown and one interception.

The performance marked his fourth-straight game with a rushing score. Bound for more than 20 touches, Henry is set to roll this week facing a Bengals defense that recently demoted some key defensive linemen.","Jones failed to reach the end zone, but was nonetheless busy, reeling in 8-of-9 targets for 97 yards in Week 7 against the Lions. A healthy Jones is matchup proof. However, this week he draws the stingy Panthers secondary in the Thursday night affair so temper expectations -- especially in the TD department, since Carolina has surrendered only five scores to wideouts in seven games.","A run-heavy approach against the Eagles a few weeks back saw Nick Boyle on the field more than Andrews, making for a forgettable fantasy outing. Given his great red zone pedigree, Andrews is still among the best weekly threats to score a receiving touchdown in the league. That fuels a solid projection for this meeting with Pittsburgh, a defense that has surrendered the seventh-fewest fantasy points to tight ends.","Woods entered the Rams' game on Monday night carrying a bit of an injury, and it seemed to slow him down a bit. He ended up catching only 3-of-5 targets for 22 yards against the Bears. That said, it was a matchup with the Bears -- one of the tougher defenses in the league -- so Woods could have simply been outmatched, given both his injury status and the opponent. He should be back to a regular workload in Week 8 against a weaker Miami defense.

Another good angle for Bell is this revenge matchup with his former team as the Chiefs enter as historic favorites. The Jets have struggled to stop opposing backfields, helping Bell's case as a flex option.","Brady exploited the soft Raiders' pass defense for 369 yards and four aerial strikes in Week 7, as well as adding a patented one-yard end-zone sneak in a 45-20 victory.

","Down 14-6 at halftime, Brady engineered another of his patented second-half comebacks in the Buccaneers nail-biting 25-23 win over the Giants on Monday night. After throwing four picks in his first four games, Brady has been mistake-free over the last four contests. Brady is once again a QB1 as he prepares for what should be a high-scoring Week 9 affair against fellow \"ancient wonder\" Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints.","Parker's short touchdown this past week came with just 0.28 yards of separation, marking his NFL-leading eighth touchdown catch on balls with less than one yard of separation since the start of last season. A groin injury limited Parker in the big win for Miami this past week, but reports suggest he could be available this week against a Cardinals secondary that has been mediocre against wideouts.",null,"No longer earning a sizable target or snap share for the Patriots, White doesn't help fantasy managers in this reduced capacity. Unless there is a sizable surge in White's role as a third-down threat, he's best left on the pine for this soft matchup with the Jets.","Fresh from a big fantasy performance against the Lions, this D/ST isn't in as good of a spot facing the run-heavy Ravens. Even with this tough matchup against the reigning MVP, there is still some appeal in this group given they've scored fewer than six fantasy points just once this season.","The good news? Kirk scored twice against the Seahawks in Week 7. The bad news? He only racked up 37 receiving yards in the process -- his third game this season with fewer than 40 yards from scrimmage. He's a fairly low-upside receiver, as even his \"big games\" don't net a huge point total. That said, he has scored four touchdowns over his last two outings and faces a Miami defense that has allowed more WR fantasy points per game than the average club. He's a risky, low-end WR3/flex pick for Week 9.","Jones continues to exhibit growing pains, though he certainly hasn't been helped by the Giants' injury-depleted offense. Some of the pitfalls are of his own doing though,  as he missed several open receivers in Monday night's gut-wrenching 25-23 loss to the Buccaneers. On tap in Week 9 is another tough defense as the Giants travel to Washington. Jones remains too risky to trust for fantasy purposes.","A red zone touchdown helped Doyle deliver a helpful outings this past week, but he was still only targeted three times in the win. The Colts don't lean heavily on any one tight end, leaving Doyle outside of the starting tier this week even as Baltimore has been mediocre against the position.",null,null,"Gameflow benefited Gibson the last time Washington took the field as they played with a lead for most of Week 7's 25-3 victory over Dallas. The rookie rumbled for 128 yards, eclipsing the century mark for the first time in his career -- as well as finding paydirt for the fourth time this season. Gibson should be busy again on Sunday as QB Kyle Allen shouldn't have to throw all that much in order to keep up with the Giants' mediocre offense. Gibson is an RB2 for Week 9, with a ton of upside."],"10":["Last week's scoreless 68-yard showing is likely what the floor looks like for a healthy Henry. Managers can confidently expect Henry to see over 20 touches against the Colts this week, a defense that has allowed the second-fewest fantasy points per game to backs. Even in a tough matchup, Henry remains a must-start fantasy fixture.",null,"A strong start the season has since seen Andrews struggle to produce meaningful statistical results the past several weeks; the hulking tight end hasn't topped 32 yards since Week 5. With the Patriots playing so much man coverage, it's still possible Andrews can win some one-on-one matchups and deliver TE1 value in Week 10 against a Patriots defense that has allowed the second-fewest fantasy points per game to tight ends.","Woods didn't see the incredible 20 targets Cooper Kupp did in Week 8, but he did add a pair of rushing attempts to his eight targets and scored a pair of touchdowns. That bodes well heading into a matchup against a Seattle team allowing the most points per game to opposing passers and receivers. Woods is a lock as a WR1 in all formats, along with Kupp, against the Seahawks.",null,"Brady usually shines in the primetime spotlight, but he turned in a real clunker in the Week 9 Sunday night affair, throwing for just 209 yards with no scores and three interceptions in the Buccaneers 38-3 loss to the Saints. However, the 43-year old signal caller historically rebounds well from duds and is in a good spot to do so again this week against the vulnerable Panthers pass defense.","After catching just one pass in Week 8, Parker and Tua Tagovailoa hooked up on six of seven targets for 64 yards in the Dolphins 34-31 win over Arizona. While it's encouraging the pair were on the same page in Week 9, Parker will next be challenged by a Chargers defense yielding the ninth fewest points per game to wideouts. Parker is still a fantasy option in Week 10, with WR3/flex expectations.",null,"Only really busy as a receiving valve with the Patriots furiously playing catchup this past Monday, White's role continues to prove atypically limited, as even Rex Burkhead ran more routes in Week 9. Next up is an unsavory matchup with a Ravens defense proving stingy against backfields.","This D/ST has produced at least six fantasy points in all but one outing this season, a feat of consistency rarely found at this fickle position. The Titans present a unique challenge in that they could offset the Colts' playmakers on defense by controlling the rushing phase, but this group's unique fantasy consistency merits the benefit of the doubt.","Kirk has been red-hot of late, racking up five touchdowns over the past three games and going over 100 yards for the first time this season in Week 9 against the Dolphins. He's yet to catch more than five passes in a game and, with DeAndre Hopkins on the roster, Kirk is unlikely to be the leading receiver week-in and week-out. Regardless, he's riding a hot streak and certainly worthy of flex consideration, even against a Buffalo defense among the top 10 in preventing opposing receivers from scoring fantasy points.","Jones did just enough to lead the Giants to a 23-20 victory over Washington in their Week 9 NFC East battle. Jones threw for only 21 with once score, but most importantly he wasn't picked off for only the second time in nine games. The Eagles visit East Rutherford in Week 10 for another NFC East tussle. Until he develops more constancy, Jones belongs on the fantasy sidelines.","A concussion suffered in the first half of the Colts' Week 9 loss ended Doyle's game early. Both Trey Burton and Mo Alie-Cox earned more snaps and routes as a result. With Doyle's status seriously in question for this division rivalry against the Titans this week, shares of Burton could prove more valuable.",null,null,"Game flow forced Gibson to take the back seat in favor of J.D. McKissic, Washington's better pass-catching back in The Football Team's Week 9 loss to the Giants. Gibson carried the rock just six times, accumulating 20 yards.

Gibson checks in with RB2 status for Week 10."],"11":["The Titans have now lost twice this season when Henry has reached 100 yards, marking the only two such games they've ever lost when he reaches this threshold. Henry looked great on tape in Week 10 and should again overcome a tough matchup to deliver a solid outing this week against the Ravens.","When the Falcons last took the field in Week 9, Jones snapped a two-week scoring drought with a 21-yard TD catch. With an extra week to heal from any residual effects from the lingering sore hamstring plaguing him earlier in the season, Jones should be primed for this week's clash with NFC South rival New Orleans. As usual, Jones is one of the top WR plays on the board.","With Nick Boyle suffering a serious injury the team's recent loss, Andrews is expected to play a much higher snap rate going forward. After all, this gifted pass-catcher netted season highs in receptions and yards this past week. With the Titans struggling in coverage thus far this season, Andrews makes for a solid fantasy starter this week. ","While Woods has been consistently involved in the Rams offense, his usual reliable production has been uneven, with Week 10's five catches for 33 yards being on the low-end of the spectrum. Woods' floor still positions him an every-week play. Just temper your expectations in Week 11 as the Rams travel to Tampa Bay for a Monday night tilt against a Buccaneers defense coming off a strong performance in Carolina.","Earning a sizable share of backfield touches upon arriving on the Chiefs' roster, Bell has become a risky flex play for those in deeper leagues. The floor is fairly low given the presence of a talented rookie rusher in the same backfield, while a nice matchup awaits the Chiefs' ground game with the Raiders struggling to contain enemy backs.","As he has done so many times throughout his historic career, Brady rebounded from a subpar effort by throwing for 341 yards in Week 10. He added three passing scores, along with a patented sneak into the end zone. For his efforts, Brady is rewarded with a primetime encounter with the Rams on Monday night. Brady will face the league's third-best unit defending the pass, dropping him down to streaming range for Week 11.","Yet to truly connect with his rookie signal-caller, Parker struggled this past in hauling in only two of his team-leading seven targets. The role remains pretty awesome, though, as Parker often leads the team in air yardage and red zone attention, signaling flex value heading into this meeting with a Denver secondary that has allowed roughly 39 fantasy points per game.",null,"In what has become a two-man committee approach from the backfield in New England, it appears White is the third option. Only on the field for eight snaps this past week and with a month straight with fewer than 40 receiving yards, it's becoming clear this once high-floor gem is now merely a bench stash heading into this meeting with Houston.","It's admittedly tough to fade a D/ST that has produced at least 10 fantasy points in three of the past five games, but then again, they didn't face an efficient Aaron Rodgers in any of those meetings. Given the long sample of success this defense has enjoyed this season, it's fine to roll with them even against a solid opposing passer, albeit with a bit more risk involved.","Kirk was quiet in Week 10 by his recent standards, catching 4-of-6 targets for just 27 yards in Arizona's last-play victory over Buffalo. In that contest, Kirk was held out of the end zone for the first time in four weeks. Kirk is in a great spot to get back on track as a WR3/flex option for this week's Thursday road encounter with Seattle and the league's most porous secondary.",null,"A possible return to the lineup for Doyle simply means competing for a finite batch of routes and targets on a low-octane passing game. With both Trey Burton and Mo Alie-Cox poised as better playmakers than Doyle at this point and a solid pass defense up next, you can look for stronger streaming options than this low-ceiling vet.",null,null,"Gibson has become somewhat of a TD machine for Washington, rushing for his sixth and seventh scores of the season in a Week 10 loss to the Lions. Sharing the workload with J.D. McKissic, Gibson compiled 65 scrimmage yards on 17 touches. The backfield time-share limits the upside of both backs, but either man can be deployable as an RB2 for this week's home tussle with the Bengals."],"12":["Adding to his legend as an early-down force amid a pass-happy NFL climate, Henry just became the first NFL player ever to tally two overtime rushing scores in the same season. Henry also became the third player in franchise history to produce at least 1,000 rushing yards in his first 10 appearances of a season. Proving productive against the Colts a few weeks back, Henry merits trust in all formats this week.","Jones played on only 35 snaps in Week 11 as a hamstring issue required frequent visits to the sidelines for treatment. While on the field, he managed only a tepid two catches for 39 yards as he was clearly hobbled. Jones heads into the Falcons' Week 12 contest with the Raiders as a game-time decision.","The recent injury to Nick Boyle has had a real influence on Andrews' opportunity rates the past two weeks; he just delivered a season-high in yardage in Week 11 and has posted at least five catches in consecutive games for the first time this season.","Both Woods and Cooper Kupp went over 100 yards through the air in Week 11, as the Rams opted to throw the ball against a Tampa Bay defense that's great against the run. It clearly paid off and we can expect more of the same in Week 12. The 49ers have a top-10 run defense, meaning Woods (and Kupp) should be busy once more. Woods is a solid option as a WR3/flex in all leagues.","Getting into the end zone for the first time with the Chiefs this past week, Bell's workload has been light enough to consider him a poor play heading into a meeting with the league's best rush defense.","The recipe is clear. Give Brady time to throw and he'll pick you apart. Pressure him and the 43-year-old veteran is no longer able to avoid mistakes. The Rams kept the heat on  Brady for the entirety of Week 11's Monday night contest, limiting the veteran to 216 yards and two interceptions -- including a bad overthrow as the Buccaneers attempted to engineer a potential game-winning drive. Brady has a history of rebounding, so look for a QB1-level performance when the high-scoring Chiefs visit Raymond James Stadium in Week 12.","A rare bright spot for the Miami offense this past week, Parker delivered a touchdown in tough circumstances. With the Jets allowing the sixth-most fantasy points per game to receivers, it's a good week to deploy Parker in lineups.",null,"With Rex Burkhead out for the season, White is poised to reclaim his valuable share of the team's passing game. The holdup in getting excited is just how ineffective the New England passing game has proven this season, but at least there are some inviting matchup metrics in place against Arizona this week.","One of the steadiest options at an often unsteady position in fantasy terms, the Colts' defense produced a dozen fantasy points against the Titans just two weeks back, solidifying this group's value for this week's rematch.","Kirk has not yet had more than five receptions in any game this season, limiting his upside as a fantasy option -- despite promising performances when given his chances. He's on the outside looking in for Week 12 lineups, even against a middling New England pass defense.","Jones is near the bottom of the QB heap in terms of passing yards per game but he ranks third in rushing yards per contest. While the ground production is nice, it's usually not enough to merit fantasy consideration. Week 12 is an exception, as his combination of running ability along with throwing proficiency in regards to the deep ball puts Jones in play as a spot-starter against a suspect Bengals defense.","Chasing touchdowns could be the name about a book on fantasy tight ends, as this volatile position often has us hunting last week's trip to the end zone. Doyle ran the fewest routes of the team's three tight ends last week, so his touchdown seems a bit aberrational. You can safely fade him against the Titans this week.",null,null,"Gibson scored a rushing touchdown for the fourth consecutive game in Washington's Week 11 win over the Bengals. The rookie back missed practice on Monday, but it's unclear if that was just precautionary in advance of Thursday's game in Dallas or if it portends something more serious. If Gibson can suit up, he's in a favorable spot against a Dallas front surrendering the second-most rushing yards per game in the NFL."],"13":["This dude might just be good at running the football. For confirmation, we can look to the absurdly productive outing Henry delivered this past Sunday in drubbing the rival Colts, as the pride of Yulee High posted his third career effort with at least 175 yards and three rushing scores, leaving only Hall of Famers Jim Brown (five) and  LaDainian Tomlinson (four) as the only players in history with more such performances. The Browns have been solid against the run this season in allowing the 10th-feewest rushing yards per game to backfields, but Henry is known for defying matchup metrics.","A hamstring issue kept Jones out of the Falcons' Week 12 contest, his third DNP of the season, but the first since Week 5. Atlanta cruised without their No. 1 receiver but could use him for their Week 13 tilt with New Orleans. The Saints boast a strong pass defense, but if he plays, Jones is matchup-proof.","Andrews missed Week 12's tilt with the rival Steelers due to a positive COVID-19 result, placing his status for Week 13's matchup with the Cowboys in doubt. If he's active in time for this inviting matchup with one of the leagues' weakest pass defenses, Andrews would be a top option at his position.","Woods was one of few bright spots for the Rams in a disappointing Week 12 effort, racking up 88 yards from scrimmage and getting eight total touches against a very tough defense. Things should get easier in Week 13 against the Cardinals. Woods has been a bit more consistent than teammate Cooper Kupp this season, making him a bit easier to lock into your lineup as a WR1 for what the Rams hope will be a rebound game for their entire offense.","Consuming roughly 40% of the backfield opportunities in most outings with Kansas City, Bell doesn't see the ball enough to help fantasy rosters, but just enough to fell real fantasy fun for his rookie backfield peer. The Broncos were just gashed badly by the New Orleans running game, but it's unlikely Bell sees enough work to make the matchup matter.",null,"This dynamic contested catch maven now has six career 100-yard efforts in 20 games with Ryan Fitzpatrick behind center, compared to just four such outings in 60 starts with other signal-callers. Parker was dominant in Week 12 both in production and in his market share of the Miami offense, good signs for his potential to deliver a big line against a Bengals defense allowing roughly 38 fantasy points per game to receiving corps.",null,"Posting his third career game with multiple rushing scores this past Sunday against the Cardinals, including his epic 2018 playoff run, White has resurfaced as a helpful fantasy option now that Rex Burkhead is sidelined for the season. The lack of usage in the passing phase remains troubling for White, as he ran fewer routes than early-down maven Damien Harris, but at least there's some scoring potential against a Chargers team allowing the 10th-most fantasy points per game to backfields.","Entering Week 12 as the top fantasy defense on the season, the Colts were missing key defensive playmakers due to COVID-19 protocol in a game that saw them allow 45 points to the rival Titans, tied for the fourth-most in a home game in franchise history. With the front seven hopefully at full strength this week, Indianapolis appears set for a solid showing against a Houston offense down several key skill players. ","Kirk has not delivered a starter-worthy fantasy performance in several weeks, even with no meaningful decline in playing time or volume. He's simply not finding the end zone, so his typical handful of catches are not generating enough yardage or fantasy points without those touchdowns. That should unfortunately continue against one of the best pass defenses in football. Bench Kirk against the Rams in all but the very deepest of leagues.","Jones hurt his right hamstring on a run in the third quarter of the Giants' win over Cincinnati, though he tried to tough it out for a few plays before exiting for good. He had thrown for 213 yards with no touchdowns along with six scampers for 10 yards. While the injury is not being considered incredibly serious, Jones is nevertheless questionable heading into Week 13's visit to Seattle. If he's able to play, Jones is a streaming candidate against one of the weakest pass defenses in the NFL.","Barely on the field with Mo Alie-Cox and Trey Burton earning much more exposure this past week against the Titans, Doyle's run as a relevant fantasy option appears over for the season. The Texans have been right around league average against tight ends, but that doesn't matter much with Doyle often on the sidelines.

Even so, Gibson's play warrants low-end RB1 status."],"14":["An early blowout saw the Titans forced to pass as a means of catching up to Cleveland this past week, leaving Henry with just 15 rush attempts -- his fewest in a game since Week 9 of last season. Henry also uncharacteristically fumbled in the loss, incredibly marking his first fumble in his last 375 touches, ending the longest such active streak in the NFL. The good news for Henry and his fantasy managers is a choice matchup with a Jaguars team allowing roughly 28 fantasy points per game to backs in ESPN PPR leagues, setting up this early-down force for a big game.","After missing Week 12 due to a sore hamstring, Jones was able to suit up in Week 13 against the NFC South-leading Saints, ultiamtely hauling in 6-of-10 looks for 96 yards. The Falcons next travel to Los Angeles to take on a Chargers defense which stingy with yards to wideouts but generous in allowing touchdowns. With no ill effects from the hamstring issue, Jones is again a WR1.","Activated and able to participate in practice, Andrews is looking for this next matchup with the Browns. Cleveland, per the matchup metrics, has surrendered the second-most fantasy points to tight ends on the season. The floor might be a bit low given the struggles this passing game has endured, but Andrews' ceiling is quite high.","Woods has seen the ball thrown his way an incredible 38 times over the past three games and, while he hasn't racked up \"video-game numbers\" with that volume, he's done well enough to earn the trust of fantasy managers in key playoff matchups over the final few weeks of the NFL season. He's among the top options at his position this week, even against a solid New England secondary.","Given the start with his rookie peer ailing, Bell produced just 55 scrimmage yards on 13 touches and wasn't a real threat to provide big-play upside in the contest against Denver. The Dolphins, this week's opponent, have been average against opposing ground games, while Bell's lack of production signals too much risk to deploy him in the fantasy playoffs.","In Week 12 against the Chiefs, Brady threw for 345 yards and a pair of scores, but was also picked off twice, making it seven interceptions over his last four games. Brady and the Buccaneers come out of the Week 13 bye with a home tilt against the Vikings. Minnesota has yielded the sixth-most passing yards per game so, despite the ball-security issues, Brady is a low-end QB1 in Week 14.","An ejection in the final quarter and some missed opportunities in the end zone resulted in a modest final line for Parker in Week 13, but the usage remained quite encouraging. With at least seven targets in five straight games and plenty of attention in the red zone, Parker is a fine WR2 candidate for what should be a pass-happy game against the Chiefs.",null,"It's becoming clear that you can't trust White in fantasy lineups any longer; the veteran change-of-pace back didn't see a single rushing touch even with the team running the ball 43 times in drubbing the Chargers.

Facing a top defense this week, you should find stronger options than White.","The Colts pressured Deshaun Watson on 38% of his dropbacks, marking Indianapolisâ€™s second-highest pressure rate this season. The return of DeForest Buckner proved critical to the defensive success. The Raiders are up next and while they possess a solid offensive line, Las Vegas has badly struggled with turnovers in recent outings.","In Week 13, Kirk posted only his second game this season with fewer than two receptions, tying a season-low with just three targets.

Against a porous Jets secondary, Woods is still a strong starting candidate in all fantasy formats.","Afforded just four touches in the team's win over the Dolphins this past week, Bell is clearly just a backup option in the Kansas City offense and not a helpful fantasy starter for this upcoming meeting with the Saints.","Brady didn't put up gaudy numbers in Week 14, but he didn't have to in order to engineer the Buccaneers' home win against the Vikings. The veteran threw for only 196 yards but added two scores -- marking the fourth straight game (and seventh of the last eight) in which Brady has thrown for multiple tocuhdowns. Next up is a road tilt against the Falcons and one of the softest pass defenses in the league, landing Brady as a low-end QB1 for Week 15.","An injury saw Parker sidelined just before the half, leaving him without a reception in a challenging matchup with the Chiefs.

The Texans have been brutal in pass protection this season, setting up this defense with a high floor and ceiling as one of the best plays at the position.","Kirk has been almost entirely phased out of the Cardinals offense in recent weeks, handling his usual number of snaps but not getting enough targets or meaningful touches. The Arizona offense has been facing very tough pass defenses of late and, as a result, Kirk has not been able to connect with Kyler Murray in those matchups. The Eagles struggle against receivers but are generally good against the pass, meaning this isn't a great spot for a rebound game for Kirk.","After missing Week 13 with a sore hamstring, Jones was back under center in Week 14, but it was apparent that he wasn't 100%.

Without the fun target volume that drives Kelce's elite yardage output, Andrews is decidedly more dependent on touchdown production, but at least he's a top target in his offense and faces a Giants team that is right around league average in defending tight ends.","Woods has maintained his top receiver status, even with the rest of the Los Angeles offense stumbling at times this season. He's picked up at least eight targets in five straight games and hauled in a touchdown in his most recent effort to rebound a bit after a poor Week 14 outing.

Back in Week 5 against the Bengals, Andrews delivered a touchdown and six catches, evidence he can thrive again this week.","Woods will be playing with a first-time starter under center in Week 17, limiting his upside and making him a tough pick for those in pivotal fantasy matchups. That said, he's been the more productive Los Angeles receiver over recent weeks and is a WR2/WR3 in most formats given his big-play potential.","Week 16 seemed like an ideal opportunity for Bell to enjoy a featured role in the Chiefs' offense, but it was Darrel Williams who earned more meaningful work. With the Chiefs locked into the top playoff spot in the AFC, Bell could again pay a limited role in this division matchup with the Chargers.","In Week 16, Brady played only one half of football. So what? In his 30 minutes, he threw for 348 yards and four touchdowns as the Buccaneers trounced the Lions. Tampa Bay has clinched a playoff spot, but head coach Bruce Arians has stated he's playing to win in Week 17 since a higher seed is on the line. This bodes well for Brady as a QB1. Despite the Falcons' surprising Week 16 effort against the Chiefs, they've yielded the second-most passing yards per game this season.","Parker missed Week 16 with a hamstring injury, but would become an intriguing flex play this week if active given his ability to secure contested catches. The Bills have a respectable pass defense, with Parker entering the finale with some degree of matchup risk.",null,"A lack of overall inclusion in the offense has led to a quiet season for White, including last week's seven-touch showing. Even as the Jets make for a choice matchup, White isn't bankable enough to ride with in the fantasy postseason.","A negative fantasy outcome was the result of the Colts' duel with the Steelers this past week, as Indianapolis allowed 28 points and wasn't able to produce any meaningful big plays on defense. This week, however, the Colts net an entirely favorable matchup with the Jaguars, positioning this D/ST as arguably the top play at the position for Week 17.","In the team's Week 16 loss to the 49ers, Kirk had his best fantasy output in well over a month, fueled by his first 10-target game of the season. He'll need that increase in volume to remain for Week 17 to even have a chance of being a recommended fantasy pick against the top-tier Rams' pass defense. Look elsewhere for your flex.","After missing Week 15 with hamstring and ankle woes, Jones was back at the helm in Week 16, albeit devoid of his usual mobility. He completed 21-of-41 passes for 252 yards and a score but ran the ball just once for three yards. Jones will be under center in Week 17 when the Giants face the Cowboys, with the winner hoping for a Washington loss so they can back into the NFC East title. Even so, he's too risky for fantasy purposes.","We often hear about committee backfields, but the Colts apply this strategy to their group of tight ends, with Doyle, Trey Burton, and Mo Alie-Cox all sharing the workload at the position. Doyle led this trio with six targets last week, but had just two targets in Week 15. Given the unpredictable nature of the group's workload, even a nice matchup with the Jaguars is avoidable.",null,null,"Back from injury, Gibson had a solid Week 16, rushing 10 times for 61 yards along with three grabs for another eight yards. However, his TD total remains stuck at 11 as he was unable to find paydirt in Washington's loss to Carolina. With a playoff spot on the line, Gibson should see the bulk of the carries when Washington takes on the Eagles in Week 17. He's safe to start in your fantasy

returns as the feature back in Tennessee after pacing the NFL in carries (303), rushing yards (1,540) and rushing touchdowns (16) in 2019. Henry has been an absolute force as a rusher, ranking no lower than third in YAC each of the past three seasons. His heavy recent workload is a concern, but the good news is that he's 25 years old and had not cleared 215 carries in a season prior to 2019. Henry's minimal workload as a receiver (career-high 18 receptions last season) will continue to limit his fantasy output, so coupled with a probable dip in rushing production, he should be valued as a back-end RB1.","Jones is now 31 years old but remains an elite fantasy weapon as Matt Ryan's top target in the pass-heavy Atlanta offense. Jones continues to underwhelm in the touchdown department (only 6.2 scores per season since 2014), but he more than makes up for it with both massive targets (10.5 per game over the past two seasons) and receiving yardage (ranked among the top three WRs in each of the past six seasons). Jones' career-low YPT and RAC marks last season are a slight concern for a player now in his 30s, but his heavy usage positions him well for a run at a seventh straight top-seven fantasy campaign. Draft him in the second round.","A 2018 third-round pick, Andrews exited his rookie campaign seemingly set to become one of the league's next great tight ends. It's fair to say he delivered the goods in 2019. Despite ranking 40th at the position in snaps, Andrews handled a massive 25% target share for Baltimore's league-best offense en route to a TE5 fantasy campaign. Andrews' 11 end zone targets tied for most among tight ends and eighth in the entire league. That helped him to 10 touchdowns. Andrews' has ranked no lower than fifth in aDOT or YPR during his two pro seasons. Lamar Jackson's top target enters his age-24 season as a solid TE1 option.","Woods doesn't get the headlines, but the 2013 second-round pick has emerged as the high-scoring Rams' No. 1 wide receiver. A top-15 fantasy WR in both of the past two seasons, Woods was targeted nine-plus times in 10 of his 15 games last season. That 67% rate was tied with DJ Moore for fifth best in the league. Woods isn't going to get you many touchdowns, as he's never been above six in a season and saw only two end-zone targets last season. Still, he's a strong bet to push for 130 targets for the third consecutive season. Especially with Brandin Cooks gone, Woods is a fine WR2 target in PPR leagues.","Despite a healthy dose of turmoil during the 2019 season, Bell is back as the Jets' feature back. Bell's first season in New York saw him rank no lower than 11th among backs in carries, targets, receptions and receiving yards. However, Bell ended up just 16th among backs in fantasy points, due to a low touchdown total (four) and horrific efficiency (3.2 YPC, 5.9 YPT). Bell's heavy volume allowed him a high floor (double-digit points all but one week), but he no longer has an elite ceiling (one weekly finish better than ninth). Bell is now 28 years old and hasn't appeared in 16 regular-season games since 2014. He's no longer an RB1, though an improved Jets offensive line helps his 2020 prospects.","In case you were living under a rock during the offseason, Tom Brady is now on the Buccaneers. The 43-year-old hasn't been much of a fantasy force in recent seasons, having finished 12th or worse among QBs in fantasy points in three of the past four seasons and four of the past seven. He's also coming off arguably his worst professional season (24 pass TDs, 61% completion rate, 6.6 YPA). Of course, there's plenty of reason to expect a bounce-back in Tampa, as his top targets go from Julian Edelman, James White and Mohamed Sanu to Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and old friend Rob Gronkowski. Brady adds very little with his legs but avoids turnovers and figures to push the ball downfield more in Bruce Arians' high-volume, pass-first attack. Consider the GOAT a back-end QB1.","It's not often that a player realizes his potential in his fifth NFL season, but that was exactly what happened for Parker last season. After failing to post a single top-50 campaign while totaling nine touchdowns during his first four seasons in Miami, Parker exploded for a 72-1,202-9 receiving line in his first year working with Brian Flores. He ended up as fantasy's No. 11 WR and finished top five in routes run, receiving yards and touchdowns. The 27-year-old has first-round pedigree and had suffered through several injuries, so the leap wasn't a major shock, but we also should proceed with caution in 2020. Miami's top offensive target is safest when targeted as a WR3.","Cohen returns as Chicago's change-of-pace and extremely-busy receiving back. Believe it or not, Cohen ranks fourth among backs in both targets (261) and receptions (203) since entering the NFL in 2017. Cohen's 190-pound frame has limited him to no more than 99 carries in a single season and a grand total of four carries inside the 5-yard line. However, 70-plus catches each of the past two seasons has helped him to fantasy finishes of 11th in 2018 and 27th in 2019. Cohen's efficiency was extremely poor last season (3.3 YPC, 4.4 YPT), and he'll remain limited as a rusher and at the goal line, but his role isn't expected to change in 2020, which locks him into the PPR flex discussion.","White has finished as a top-20 fantasy RB each of the past two seasons, but he's a bit of a wild card now that old reliable Tom Brady is out of the picture. We can't bank on carries from White (he has never cleared 94 in a single season), but he has ranked no lower than sixth among backs in targets, catches, receiving yards and touchdown receptions each of the past two seasons. White is a strong bet to remain New England's primary passing-down back, but we can't assume Cam Newton or Jarrett Stidham will target him as often, and the safe bet would be to expect less scoring and a more run-heavy approach from the Patriots' offense. White still has PPR value, but he's more of a fringe flex with a limited ceiling.","The Colts' D/ST has finished 13th in fantasy points each of the past two seasons, but the unit is trending up following the offseason acquisition of star DT DeForest Buckner. The former 49ers standout should help generate pressure for a unit that has finished top 10 in interceptions each of the past two seasons, but 15th or worse in sacks each of the past five seasons. The Indianapolis defense otherwise saw only minor offseason turnover and returns a unit led by Buckner, Justin Houston, Darius Leonard, Kenny Moore and Malik Hooker. As an added bonus, Nyheim Hines was responsible for two of the league's seven punt return touchdowns last season. Consider the Colts' D/ST a midrange starting unit.","After flashing in a situational role as a rookie in 2018, Kirk saw a boost in usage and was the WR29 during 13 active weeks last season. The former second-round pick handled a very generous 24% target share in his first season with Kyler Murray in Kliff Kingsbury's system. However, he didn't see much work near the goal line (only four end-zone targets) and his 6.8 YPT ranked near the basement of the league. Moving forward, Kirk is a near lock for a big reduction in targets with superstar DeAndre Hopkins now sitting atop the depth chart. Kirk, who has already missed seven games due to injury, will also need to fend off Larry Fitzgerald, Hakeem Butler and Andy Isabella (among others) for targets. The 23-year-old is no more than a borderline flex in deeper leagues.","Jones was in and out of the lineup during his rookie campaign, but the 2019 sixth overall pick certainly made an impact when on the field. During 12 starts, Jones paced all rookie QBs with 24 pass TDs and was fifth in fantasy points. Jones' efficiency wasn't good (62% completion rate, 6.6 YPA), but inconsistency is common for rookie passers. Despite the Giants' top targets playing zero games together due to injury, the New York offense ranked 13th in touchdowns during Jones' rookie campaign. Jones is armed with a solid supporting cast and adds value with his legs (he ranked seventh in rushing yards as a rookie). Consider him a fringe top-12 QB and a breakout candidate.","With Eric Ebron out of the picture, Doyle has regained his status as the Colts' clear top tight end. We got a glimpse of what that could look like late last season as Doyle tied for the team lead with 31 targets (20% share) once Ebron went on IR after Week 12. Doyle was held to two top-10 fantasy weeks and one finish better than eighth on the season, but there are reasons for optimism. Coach Frank Reich's tight end units have never combined for a target share below 23% in six seasons as a coach/OC. Also, new QB Philip Rivers made heavy usage of Antonio Gates and Hunter Henry in recent years with the Chargers. Doyle, who ranked sixth at tight end with eight end zone targets last season, should be viewed as a fringe top-15 fantasy TE in his age-30 season.","After failing to make an impact during his first two NFL seasons, Gonzalez surged to the sixth-most fantasy points at the position in 2019. In what was his first full season with Arizona, Gonzalez produced 11 top-10 fantasy weeks, which tied for most. His 35 field goal attempts were third most in the league and, though his 88.6% field goal percentage was eighth best, it was certainly inflated by an average distance of 33.5 yards, which was the shortest in the league. Arizona's offense is a candidate for a leap in quarterback Kyler Murray's second season, which makes Gonzalez a fine last-round flier.","A 2019 second-round pick, Campbell appeared to be well-positioned for a huge rookie season in the WR-needy Indianapolis offense. Instead, the speedy short-area weapon was limited by injury to a mere 22 touches in seven games. Campbell will be an intriguing post-hype sleeper in his second season, especially with Philip Rivers now under center. The Colts' depth chart remains wide open behind 30-year-old T.Y. Hilton, with Campbell and rookie Michael Pittman Jr. likely to handle big roles. Campbell is super-fast (a 4.31 40-yard dash) and quick (a 4.03 short shuttle) with the ability to contribute from the slot, as a rusher and as a returner. He's well worth grabbing for your bench.","Washington selected Gibson with the 66th pick of April's draft. Gibson appeared to be entering the league as more of an 'offensive weapon' than a wide receiver or running back, but he has settled in as the team's lead back, even drawing comparisons to Christian McCaffrey by head coach Ron Rivera. The Memphis product is big (6-foot, 228 pounds) and a terrific athlete with excellent power, speed (4.39 40-yard dash) and elusiveness. He's a terror with the ball in his hands, having averaged 8.4 yards per carry and 13.1 yards per target (11.9 RAC) in 2019. Experience is a concern here (33 carries and 66 targets in two FBS seasons), but it appears he's done enough to play a huge role as a rookie.

leader at his position in fantasy production in each of the past four seasons, Kelce is a must-start fantasy superstar at this point of his career. It's fun to consider what he can accomplish to open the season heading into a matchup with a Houston defense that allowed the seventh-most yards to tight ends in 2019.","The best tight end in fantasy football is back and ready for business. The focal point of his team's offense, he thrives as a point-per-reception machine at a position often led by players who are far more TD-dependent. Kittle can score, as well, but he doesn't have to do so in order to deliver a great performance for you each week. In Week 1, he's facing the best matchup a tight end can find in the NFL, the Arizona Cardinals. This is as no-brainer a decision as it gets. ",null,null,"Metcalf made his fair share of big plays in his rookie campaign, averaging over 15.0 YPC and scoring seven times. A favorite of those who look to advanced metrics to judge fantasy potential, Metcalf has both the size and ability to be a force in Year 2. He's well worth a spot in your lineup as a WR3/flex against a middling Falcons defense.","Unique consistency from this D/ST -- which has finished in the top eight in fantasy points in four of the past five seasons -- helps fuel confidence for a strong debut against a young and mistake-prone Giants offense. With proven pass rushers and playmakers in the back seven, Pittsburgh is a top D/ST option for Week 1.","A savvy blend of playmakers at each level of this defense combined with strong scheming helps this D/ST sustain value as a high-end fantasy option. For a defense that allowed just 5.3 yards per dropback to opponents last year, a meeting with a seemingly limited Jets offense sets up a good start to the campaign. ","The Eagles tried to add some more talent at the WR position this offseason by drafting Jalen Reagor. However, he's unlikely to play in Week 1, leaving Wentz with a similarly inconsistent crew to the one he struggled with at times last year. He's a start-worthy quarterback most weeks given his volume, but his upside is amplified against a porous Washington defense in Week 1. Start him in any league, even with many of his receivers hurt.","Mattison is the backup to a proven starter on a team that loves to run the ball, meaning his value is almost entirely dependent on the health and availability of Dalvin Cook. In Week 1, with Cook healthy, Mattison lacks fantasy upside. Keep him around as a backup plan.","A shoulder injury in camp could see Williams miss this friendly first matchup with the Bengals, according to reports. A proven big-play threat who averaged 20.4 yards per catch last season, managers might need to prove patient with Williams to open the season.","Lazard has emerged from the Packers' WR ranks as the most likely to start alongside Davante Adams, but he's unlikely to soar to super-stardom based solely on that new role. Green Bay has been looking for a complement to Adams for quite a while now, and Lazard has yet to prove he can provide that level of play on a consistent basis. Even against a shaky Vikings secondary, he's best kept on the bench for Week 1.","Washington didn't have much going its way, with or without the ball last season. They'll be expected to lose to the Eagles on their home turf in Week 1. This unit scored in the negatives more times than it reached double-digits in 2019. It's best to leave this D/ST on waivers.","Trubisky appears to be set to start for the Bears in Week 1, despite the arrival of Nick Foles. However, it would be unwise to trust either signal-caller in Chicago this season, as it's unlikely either is going to provide a ton of fantasy value and we may well see both under center from time to time. The Lions provide a great matchup for quarterbacks but, in Week 1, you've certainly got better options.","Kentucky's all-time leading rusher reportedly enjoyed a strong camp with the Steelers this summer, positioning him as the key early-down understudy to James Conner heading into the season. Not expected to handle much work against the Giants to open the campaign, Snell Jr. is merely a deep-league insurance policy. ","Smith has found his way to the end zone 10 times over his first two seasons, but has otherwise lacked the volume necessary to be a consistent fantasy option. With Emmanuel Sanders joining the Saints, Smith is locked into a tertiary role and shouldn't be on your radar for fantasy at this time."],"2":["As steady and productive as any skill player of the past five years, Kelce's rewarding claim of offensive bandwidth on the Chiefs drives consistent value. The Chargers are among the better secondaries in football, but are notably missing Derwin James for what is still a positive matchup for Kelce this week.","Kittle picked up right where he left off as a key member of the San Francisco passing game before leaving with a knee injury in Week 1. If he's healthy enough to play, lock him into your Week 2 lineups against the Jets. Just be sure to keep a close eye on those injury reports.",null,null,"Metcalf and Tyler Lockett both saw eight targets in Week 1. If Russell Wilson can keep both players involved in the passing game this season, fantasy managers can trust in both to delvier solid points totals each week. Metcalf is a bigger red-zone threat but still has big play potential, as he demonstrated in Week 1. Even in a tough matchup with New England in Week 2, he's a must start as a WR2/flex.","A slow start led to another stronger overall outing for this elite defensive group, as Pittsburgh held the Giants to just 24 net rushing yards while hitting their backs were hit 1.3 yards behind the line of scrimmage on average. The Steelers also led the league in blitzes and pressures in Week 1, setting up a strong Week 2 showing against a young Denver offense.","Ryan Fitzpatrick was a turnover machine last week against the Patriots, meanwhile Buffalo was third in the league last week in blitz rate. With Buffalo's aggressive and talented defense, this D/ST can be considered a top unit for Week 2. ","Wentz was on-target early, staking the Eagles to a 17-0 lead in Week 1. However, after that start, Washington dialed up the pass rush and Wentz struggled, finishing with just 270 yards in the air and a pair of scores to go along with two picks. Week 2 presents a matchup with a Rams defense that has the ability to pressure the passer, but is not as solid as Washington in other areas. With a week for Philadelphia to work on pass protection, Wentz should be considered as a borderline QB1 this time around.","Mattison looked sharp in limited playing time in Week 1, chipping in 80 total yards on 10 touches. However, he played on only 19 snaps and will always finish behind Dalvin Cook for meaningful opportunities in this Vikings offense. He's a great backup plan for those who roster Cook, but he shouldnt be started until there is a depth-chart shakeup.","A series of acrobatic catches and a team-high rate of targets per route are positive outcomes from his first game working with Tyrod Taylor. With an average depth of target nearly 16 yards down the field in Week 1, Williams profiles as a worthy boom-or-bust flex against the Chiefs. ","Lazard appears to be locked in as the No. 2 receiver for Green Bay, seeing playing time on almost every snap and representing one of only three wideouts to see the field for more than one play in the game. He turned in a solid outing, hauling in a touchdown and catching every one of his targets. Ultimately, though, four targets will not be enough for automatic inclusion in your fantasy lineup. Keep an eye on him, but he's best left on the bench for Week 2. ","Last season, Washington's defense was one of the poorest in the league. Despite an inspired performance in the opener featuring a dialed-up pass rush, it's best to take the wait-and-see approach here and look elsewhere for your Week 2 D/ST.","Trubisky was solid  in Week 1, tossing three touchdown passes and avoiding turnovers against the Lions. This week, he will face a similarly poor Giants pass defense, so we can probably expect more of the same. Trubisky isn't the safest option by any means, but if you're rotating quarterbacks from the waiver wire on a weekly basis, he's among the top options against a squad that allowed the fourth-most points to passers last season.","The Steelers ran on the vast majority of Snell's snaps once James Conner went down early with an ankle injury in Week 1. A busy early-down role led to Snell producing a career-high in rushing. If Conner is out this week against the Broncos, a team that just struggled to contain the Titans, Snell makes for a great plug-and-play.","With the Saints gameplan focusing on short passes, there wasnâ€™t much for Smith to do in Week 1. He ended up catching one ball on only four targets despite playing on 44 snaps. In general, this will be the case, though Smith could see more attention with Michael Thomas likely to be missing for several weeks due to a high-ankle sprain. If Thomas is on your roster, consider grabbing Smith this week."],"3":["Leading the Chiefs with 20 targets and 15 receptions through two outings, Kelce also leads the team in target percentage per route run at a robust 27.4%, confirming how integral he's become to this elite offense. The Ravens have actually struggled a bit against tight ends to begin the season in allowing the sixth-most yards to the position through two weeks.","Kittle is aiming to return from injury in Week 3, but that might be a bit ambitious. Jordan Reed filled in for him quite nicely in Week 2, which might help the 49ers slow down what could be a rushed return to action from their superstar tight end. If he's healthy, he's a must-start as always. Just keep an eye on his health heading into Sunday's matchup.",null,null,"Metcalf has hauled in four passes and gone over 90 yards while finding the end zone in both games to begin the season. This consistency is a huge plus from the big-play-capable sophomore and, with Russell Wilson playing so well, he should remain a fixture in fantasy lineups for weeks to come. He's a solid WR2 pick against a Dallas defense that couldn't keep up with the Falcons' passing game in Week 2.","The Steelers have now tallied at least one sack on defense in 59 straight games, tying the-longest streak by any team since 1970. The Texans, meanwhile, have allowed the fifth-highest pressure rate to opponents this season.","The Bills have a deep defense that relies on the blitz often to create pressure. The Rams have a deep offense that relies on misdirection and play-action to create paths. In a solid matchup for Buffalo, this D/ST is merely in the streaming tier given the riskier opponent.","In a season with some early outstanding performances at the position, Wentz has been a disappointment among quarterbacks, though he's faced a pair of good defenses in Washington and the Rams. Week 3 against the soft Bengals defense looks to be easier, at least on paper, although it lines up better on the ground than through the air. Wentz is better than his stats indicate, but it's prudent to wait for a weaker pass defense before entrusting your fantasy fate to the Eagles signal-caller.","Mattison took a step back in playing time and touches in Week 2 as the Vikings stumbled through a poor game on offense. Any hopes that Mattison might become a viable starter alongside Dalvin Cook need to be set aside for the moment. He's best left on benches as a backup plan should anything happen to Cook.","A gifted 50/50 ball threat, Williams is likely better off from a fantasy perspective if Justin Herbert takes over the offense. Even with Tyrod Taylor behind center, however, Williams merits interest from fantasy managers thanks to a choice matchup with some exploitable outside corners for Carolina.","Lazard led the Packers in snaps at receiver with Davante Adams spending a good amount of time on the sidelines with a hamstring injury. Unfortunately, he still saw only five passes thrown his way, just three of which were caught. He's failed to deliver many big performances even when handed increased playing time. As such, even with Adams potentially out in Week 3, he'd be a risky flex pick. If Adams plays, Lazard is not a name to consider at all for your fantasy lineup.","It's strength versus strength as the staunch Washington run defense will be tasked with containing the Browns two-headed monster of Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt. Matchups of this ilk rarely result in D/ST fantasy points so it's best to leave the Washington unit on the sidelines.","The yards certainly haven't been there, but Trubisky has delivered five touchdowns over the first two weeks of the season. It might be tempting to consider him for your fantasy lineup against an Atlanta team that's allowed the most QB fantasy points so far this season, but don't lock him into your lineup without considering your alternatives. He's a viable starter, but with a low ceiling due to his lack of yardage and rushing upside.","Four touches and a single scrimmage yard was the result for Snell with James Conner dominating work in Week 2. While still a worthy insurance option, Snell isn't a viable play now that Conner is back in the mix for this meeting with a leaky Houston defense.","Smith was the lone wideout to pick up the slack with Michael Thomas sidelined, catching five balls on seven targets for 86 yards.

Lock him in as a solid WR2 in all formats against a Miami defense allowing the 11th-most points to opposing wideouts this season.","This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","The Buffalo defense seems to live on pressure, as they've created the fifth-most pressures in the NFL this season. The Raiders, however, have allowed pressure on just 22.1% of dropbacks, the 10th-lowest clip in football. In the end, it's not an ideal matchup for this D/ST with the Raiders' protection rate proving less inviting.  ","Drafted by many as their starting quarterback, Wentz has been a fantasy disappointment. After three weeks of play, he barely makes the top-20 at the position . With a better supporting cast and more experience, Wentz should be able to take better advantage of an injury-depleted San Francisco defense than Giants quarterback Daniel Jones did last week. Even so, until he displays a consistently higher level of performance, Wentz should stay on the fantasy sidelines.","Mattison picked up a solid eight carries off the bench in Week 3, but still remains more of a backup plan for Dalvin Cook than a standalone fantasy option. He should remain on the bench for Week 4.","Held to just 21 routes due to a hamstring injury, Williams isn't a bankable fantasy factor even if healthy facing a Buccaneers defense that has had some early success defending receivers. Williams is dependent on securing 50/50 balls down the field, so his injury and the tougher matchup blend to keep him off the starting radar.","Stepping up for the injured Davante Adams, Lazard had a breakout effort in Week 3, hauling in 6-of-8 targets for 146 yards and a score.

Wentz has three rushing scores this season, matching his total from his first four seasons in the league. That said, even his newfound nose for the end zone isn't enough to start Wentz against the tough Pittsburgh defense.","Mattison stepped in for Dalvin Cook in Week 4 when the Minnesota starter was briefly sidelined with an injury, and he even found the end zone during his time on the field. Let that serve as a good reminder that Mattison would be a must-have fantasy starter if Cook were to miss time. However, since Cook was in fact able to return to action in Week 4, Mattison is likely best left on the bench again in Week 5.","A hamstring injury sidelined Williams this past week.

If this is the case, pressuring Cleveland's passing game could prove quite rewarding for Pittsburgh's defense.","Even as Buffalo has proven capable on defense for much of the season, such as ranking in the top 10 in pressuring quarterbacks, facing a dangerous Kansas City offense adds real risk to this D/ST group. It's difficult in some cases to stash a defense due to a poor matchup, but that might just be the best plan for investors in Buffalo for Week 6.","With two touchdowns and a pair of interceptions in Week 5, Wentz still has thrown more picks (9) than scores (6) for the season. His 258 passing yards was his second-highest output of the year. Once an automatic fantasy starter, Wentz has a lot to prove before he can safely be considered for a return to that level.

The Steelers joined the 1985 Giants as only teams in NFL history to sustain this rate of sacks and interceptions through five games. The Titans present a real challenge given a powerful running game and dangerous play-action agenda, but this Pittsburgh defense is proving worthy of weekly trust.","The last two outings haven't been kind to the Bills' brand as a defensive force, but thankfully the schedule gets more favorable. Defenses facing the Jets have averaged a league-high 11.8 fantasy points this season, setting up Buffalo as a strong streaming option after a rough patch.","After a sluggish three quarters, Wentz reverted to 2019 form, leading the Eagles on three scoring drives and a pair of two-point conversions. Unfortunately, the last two-point conversion fell short of sending the Week 6 contest with the Ravens into overtime. While the fourth-quarter comeback was impressive, Wentz will be hard-pressed to keep the roll going on Thursday.

Those points still count, however, and should he start again, Trubisky would be in a great spot to take advantage of a Detroit team he scored three times against in Week 1. If Matt Nagy names him the starter, you can consider him as a \"pick up and play\" option for your fantasy team against one of the weakest pass defenses in football.","Elevated on the depth chart in Week 12 with James Conner sidelined, Snell Jr. consumed 19 touches and delivered solid results from scrimmage as a result. This looming matchup with the Washington Football Team isn't ideal, however, as they've ceded the third-fewest fantasy points-per game to backs and the potential return of Conner could cap Snell's role.","In the Saints' Week 12 win over Denver, Smith hauled in just his second catch of the last four games. Despite the impending Week 13 road date against the very vulnerable Falcons secondary, Smith's number isn't called enough for fantasy purposes."],"14":["Delivering true WR1 production from the tight end position, Kelce provided managers with another huge line this past Sunday. The Dolphins are one of just seven teams allowing fewer than 10 fantasy points per game to tight ends, but Kelce is simply matchup-proof.",null,null,null,"Metcalf finished with \"only\" 80 yards in Week 13, his ninth game this season with at least that much production through the air. He's emerged as one of the most consistent and explosive receivers, a rare combination of both floor and ceiling. Against the Jets, one of the worst passing defenses in football, he's an elite option in fantasy leagues of all kinds for Week 14.","The Steelers' defense didn't deliver a strong showing in Week 13, but the larger sample still supports weekly trust in a group that leads the league in pressuring opposing passers. The Bills have allowed the fourth-highest pressure rate in the league this season, supporting a respectable range of outcomes for this group.","With no more than five fantasy points in any of their past three outings, the Buffalo D/ST hasn't been a very helpful unit for managers of late. The Steelers' conservative passing game and elite pass protection rates limits the appeal for the Buffalo defense this week.","Wentz was benched for Jalen Hurts in the third quarter of Week 13's loss to Green Bay after completing just 6-of-15 passes for 79 yards and no scores. Unless your league awards style points for clipboard holding, there's no reason to look Wentz's way in Week 14.","After undergoing a successful appendectomy ahead of Week 13 action, Mattison is likely to miss another game or two for the Vikings. This should place more of the workload on the shoulders of Dalvin Cook, who will be pivotal for Minnesota as it chases a playoff spot.","Competing for valuable vertical work with rookie Jalen Guyton, Williams registered a catch rate of just 44.4% this past week and once again didn't help fantasy managers. There is always some touchdown upside present given Williams' unique contested catch abilities, but even a nice matchup with Atlanta sees him enter the week as a risky flex candidate.","Lazard continues to work his way back into the Green Bay offense following an extended absence, but he's not yet getting the volume needed to justify a spot in your fantasy lineup. Note that he's had only 14 targets over his last three games combined. Stash him on the bench, but don't plug him in as a starter against Detroit.","The Washington defense comes into Week 14 flying high after stifling Ben Roethlisberger and the previously undefeated Steelers in their Week 13 upset. Next up is a 49ers offense led by Nick Mullens, who has been picked off in four straight games. This D/ST is one of the best plays on the Week 14 ledger.","Trubisky provided the sort of outing the Bears needed in Week 13, but not one of much appeal to fantasy managers. He did not throw an interception and completed over 76% of his passes, but found the end zone only once. That's not good enough to recommend as a worthwhile starting option, even against a Houston defense that's squarely in the middle of the pack.","An early-down bruiser who couldn't get going against Washington's strong front seven this past Monday, Snell Jr. is only of note for fantasy managers if James Conner is sidelined again.","After four straight ho-hum efforts, Smith sparked the Saints' Week 13 offense with three grabs for 42 yards, including being on rhe receiving end of Taysom Hill's first ever NFL TD pass. Even with that one solid performance, Smith isn't a legitimate fantasy option when the Saints head to Philadelphia for Week 14."],"15":["Just another massive fantasy result for Kelce, who incredibly leads the entire NFL in yardage by a wide margin. Kelce just produced his 25th career game with 100 yards, breaking a tie with Hall of Famer Kellen Winslow for the third-most at the position in NFL history. The Saints' back seven is capable in coverage, but they've also yet to face a tight end of Kelce's caliber.",null,null,null,"Metcalf was one of four different Seahawks to catch a touchdown in Week 14, bringing him to 10 scores on the season. His target count has been steady in recent weeks and he's emerged as the go-to target for Russell Wilson. This week's matchup with Washington won't be easy for the Seattle passing game, but even in tougher matchups over the past month, Metcalf has delivered. Keep him in the WR1 spot of your fantasy lineup for Week 15.","Pittsburgh recorded a sack in their 70th consecutive game this past week, breaking a tie with the 1999-2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the longest streak in NFL history. Set with the league's top pass rush and with arguably the best matchup of the entire slate with the suspect Bengals' offense up next, Pittsburgh makes for the top play at the position this week.","A pick-six drove real fantasy success for this group against a struggling Pittsburgh offense in Week 14. The Broncos, meanwhile, just enjoyed an offensive explosion this past week. With a reliance on splash plays to deliver helpful fantasy results, the Bills enter this matchup with a relatively low floor, but also some notable upside.",null,"Mattison has missed a pair of games and, at this point, his return date is questionable as he recovers from an appendectomy. Even if healthy, he'd just play a bit part in a Minnesota offense led by Dalvin Cook. Mattison shouldn't be in the running for a starting spot in fantasy.","Mike Williams left Week 14 against the Falcon with a back injury after taking a hit on the Chargers' opening drive. With his status in question, Williams is too risky of an option this week against the Raiders.","Lazard has not quite returned to a full-time job with the Packers, instead splitting time with Marquez Valdes-Scantling and getting only a few passes thrown his way each week. With so much of the Packers offense going through the running backs and star wideout Davante Adams, it's hard to give Lazard a spot in your fantasy lineup this week.","Washington's defense has fueled the team's four-game winning streak that has sent The Football Team to the top of the NFC East. They'll be tested in Week 15 with the Seahawks coming to town. Even against a fairly productive offense, the Washington D/ST remains a solid play. After all, Russell Wilson has been sacked 40 times, second to only Carson Wentz, who has hit the turf 50 times this season.","In this pivotal week of the fantasy campaign, can you trust Trubisky as your starting quarterback? While he's not the ideal option, he has been performing well since returning from injury and is coming off of his best game of the season against Houston. Minnesota is near the top of the league in terms of passing touchdowns allowed, but is otherwise a fairly average pass defense. As such, Trubisky is indeed an option for those somehow desperately in need of a quarterback for Week 15.","Solely an early-down option at this stage, an injury to James Conner could see Snell Jr. serve a bigger role this week if his peer is sidelined. If Conner is active, however, Snell is merely a backup in both real and fantasy terms.","Smith put his speed to good use in Week 14, catching three balls for 60 yards. The third-year wide receiver has already set a new career-high with 33 catches on the season and is five yards shy of topping the 427 yards he recorded in his rookie season. The improvements are encouraging, but nowhere near fantasy-worthy."],"16":["Tying his career high in touchdowns this past week via a shovel pass and now just 60 yards shy of the all-time yardage record for a tight end, Kelce is well positioned to thrive this week against an Atlanta defense allowing the fifth-most fantasy points to tight ends. Start and enjoy.","Kittle is eligible to return for Week 16, but it's not clear if he will. The 49ers are not in the playoff picture and they'll need their star tight end at full strength in 2021 if they want to contend. If he plays, he's a must-start, but keep an eye on his status.",null,null,"The Seattle passing game was quiet in Week 15, but unfortunately fantasy managers can expect more of the same in the coming weeks. The Rams' top-ranked pass defense is up next for the Seahawks. This is a team which held Metcalf to just two receptions for 28 yards the last time they met. Metcalf's track record and volume make him a worthy play in most leagues, but lower your expectations.","The Steelers' relentless pass rush always keeps this D/ST relevant as a fantasy play, but it's worth noting the Colts allow one of the lower pressure rates in the league and have a rising rushing attack.","The Bills' D/ST has tallied an awesome 27 fantasy points across the past two games, the team's best two-game stretch of the season. It's unclear, however, if they can match this pace against a run-heavy Patriots team that Buffalo netted just four fantasy points against as a defense back in Week 8. Cam Newton has struggled badly as a passer, so there is upside present, but also a degree of risk.",null,"Mattison returned from his appendectomy in time to play in Week 15 but did not make a major impact. Dalvin Cook leads the way at running back for the Vikings and there's not enough volume left for Mattison to be a fantasy option.","A back ailment held Williams to just two targets in last week's win over the Raiders. With no more than four catches in any contest since Week 9, Williams' floor is quite low. This said, it's interesting to note he produced his second-best fantasy showing of the season earlier this year against the Broncos.","Lazard saw his workload tick up just a bit in Week 15 for the first time since his return from injury. He hauled in five passes in an otherwise lackluster passing performance from the Packers, and is slowly approaching starter-worthy territory. However, in such a pivotal week for most fantasy managers, it's impossible to recommend him as a fully-fledged fantasy starter just yet.","Despite the Week 15 loss to Seattle, Washington's defense limited Russell Wilson to just 18 completions in 27 attempts for only 121 yards. The Football Team's D/ST is one of the best Week 16 plays as they will welcome Teddy Bridgewater and the Panthers to FedEx Field.","The Bears rely heavily on the running game, meaning Trubisky can be shut out of the game by the success of his own offense. That's what happened in Week 15, as he was good enough to keep the offense moving but was not needed to throw the ball and, hence, failed to rack up fantasy points. Fantasy managers face a conundrum in Week 16, as the Bears have a great matchup with the Jaguars, but may not need to throw that often to earn a win. Trubisky is a risky, low-end starting option as a result.","Another injury absence for James Conner led to Snell delivering 107 scrimmage yards and a score in the team's rough loss to the Bengals this past week. Snell's value is dependent on Conner's status this week, but whoever starts would profile as a low-floor early-down option against a capable Colts front.","Smith was slated for an uptick in Week 15 target share with Michael Thomas getting placed on injured reserve. However, he caught just 1-of-2 targets for 25 yards before an injured ankle sent him to the sidelines in the Saints' loss to Kansas City. Smith is questionable for Week 16 but, even if he plays, he's not a fantasy option -- despite facing the Vikings and the league's sixth-most generous WR defense."],"17":["Kelce's season is possibly over now that the team has clinched the top spot in the AFC and surpassed George Kittle's single-season receiving yardage record for a tight end. While he could become the first tight end in league history to pace the league in receiving yardage, the team could decide to rest their key playmaker. The Chargers have allowed the 11th-most fantasy points to tight ends, but it's unlikely Kelce sees the field enough for the matchup to matter.","Kittle returned to action in Week 16 and picked up right where he had left off, racking up 92 yards and impressing for the 49ers. He'll be the focal point of the San Francisco passing game once again in Week 17 and should be in all fantasy lineups where he's available.",null,null,"Production in the passing game has been down for the Seahawks in recent weeks, and Metcalf has suffered alongside his teammates in terms of fantasy points as a result. The matchups have been especially tough, but despite the numbers suggesting otherwise, things could get easier in Week 17.  The 49ers have a solid pass defense, but Metcalf did have a huge game against them in Week 8. Metcalf is still a top-tier WR play in the final week of the season.","The Steelers' relentless pass rush led by All-Pro edge menace T.J. Watt helped secure the team a key victory this past week and keeps this defense relevant for fantasy purposes against a Browns offense that struggled badly last week against the Jets.","With at least eight fantasy points in three straight games for this D/ST, there is some momentum to consider heading into the finale. One holdup would be Miami's competent offense, which delivered this Buffalo defense with a negative fantasy outcome early in the season.",null,"Mattison has played on only six offensive snaps over the last four weeks, with three games spent entirely on the sidelines. His status for Week 17 is up in the air and, while he might have some appeal as a backup to Dalvin Cook in a game that has no significance for either team, his injury status should relegate him to the bench in all fantasy formats","It's somewhat funny that Williams became the first player to throw an interception and tally at least 50 receiving yards in a game since teammate Keenan Allen did so in 2017. Even as the Chiefs are likely to rest their key secondary playmakers this week, Williams' lack of target volume curbs his fantasy value this week.","The Packers relied on Davante Adams and AJ Dillon to carry most of their offensive load in Week 16, so Lazard ended up being limited to just a pair of catches. He's the best \"non-Adams receiver\" on the Packers, but that's not enough to earn him a spot in your fantasy lineup against a solid Chicago secondary.","If Washington manages to defeat the Eagles in the regular-season finale, they win the NFC East. If that happens, they'll have their defense to thank as the unit sits among the league-leaders in allowing the fewest scrimmage yards per game as well in securing the most sacks. Week 17's meeting with Jalen Hurts and the Eagles isn't an ideal matchup, but the Football Team's D/ST deserves a fantasy start based on their season-long prowess.","In Week 16, Trubisky did what he needed to do against the Jaguars, setting up a must-win tilt against the rival Packers for a shot at the playoffs. Green Bay is among the toughest matchups for opposing passers, but Trubisky did toss three scores against them in his first start back from the sidelines in Week 12. There's a lot of risk here -- and more than is usually desired from a Week 17 starter. It's probably best to consider other options.","Given six carries and netting zero yards this past week is further evidence that Snell should be left in fantasy free agency for this tilt with the rival Browns. ",null],"10":[null,null,null,null,"Metcalf went over 100 yards for the second time in a row in Week 9, and also racked up yet another touchdown. The Seattle wideouts have been inconsistent but boasted a high ceiling for the past two seasons, but Metcalf might have emerged as a true every-week performer at this point. With 100 yards and/or a touchdown in all but one start this season, it's easy to keep the Seattle wideout locked into your lineups for Week 10.","The fantasy floor for this D/ST thus far is four points, while you'll often net around 10 points when deploying this group. With the league's best pass rush and a matchup with a gifted rookie passer, Pittsburgh is once again an elite option on defense.","Buffalo effectively pressured Russell Wilson -- defined as creating a sack or duress in the pocket -- on a season-high 45% of his dropbacks this past Sunday. Such a successful pass rush aids fantasy production and helps this group remain relevant against another dual-threat quarterback.","Winning the game no doubt softened the blow, but Wentz can't be pleased with his Week 8 performance against the Cowboys, throwing for just 123 yards, albeit with a pair of touchdowns. However, he turned the ball over four time with two picks and two lost fumbles. With the Week 9 bye to right the ship and get some more key skill position players back in the fold, Wentz is a low end QB1 for the Eagles date with the Giants.","Don't be concerned if you check the box score and see Ameer Abdullah with a touchdown. Mattison is still the backup running back in Minnesota and handled the bulk of the snaps and touches when Dalvin Cook took a breather. Mattison does not get the volume to start with Cook healthy, but he's a great backup plan for those who roster Cook, just in case he gets hurt again.","An awesome late-game red zone grab saw Williams endure a seemingly minor injury, but the larger story from Week 9 was the awesome usage this receiver enjoyed; seven targets and plenty of air yards helped foster a strong line. Assuming he's good to go, Williams next faces a Miami secondary that has allowed the 11th-most fantasy points per game to receivers.","Lazard did not return from injury in Week 9, but Week 10 remains a possibility for the Iowa State product. Should he return, he'll look to build on his strong start to the season with a pair of touchdowns over his first three games. However, Davante Adams is the top Green Bay receiver and the only one worth a spot in your starting lineup in Week 10. Consider stashing Lazard on your bench for depth, though.","The Washington D/ST continues to excel despite getting little relief from their offensive counterparts. They rank 3rd in sacks per game and 5th in yardage allowed per game. Start the unit with confidence in their Week 10 visit to Detroit.",null,"Earning one yard on three touches this past week, Snell Jr. remains merely an early-down understudy in this offense and isn't considered a helpful option for this tilt with the Bengals.","With New Orleans top two wideouts returning to action, Smith's target share took a substantial hit, though he came through on his only catch, producing a 14-yard scoring strike.

enters the 2020 season attempting to pace all tight ends in fantasy points for the fifth consecutive season. Is that good? It seems good. Kelce continued his dominance last season by finishing as a top-13 fantasy TE every week other than 17. Kelce has finished no lower than second at the position in routes, targets, receptions and yardage each of the past three seasons. His touchdowns fell from 10 in 2018 to five in 2019, but his 7.3 OTD (second-highest) and nine end zone targets (fourth) suggest he was actually unlucky in that area. Kelce has never finished a season outside the top 10 in YPT and remains one of Patrick Mahomes' top targets. The 30-year-old is worth a look in Round 2.","Kittle wasn't much of a factor as a pass-catcher during the 49ers' Super Bowl run (8-71-0 in three games), but don't let that overshadow what was another dominant regular season. Kittle followed up his breakout 2018 season with an 85-1053-5 receiving line in 14 games in 2019. Kittle has finished no lower than fourth in targets, receptions, yardage, RAC or fantasy points each of the past two seasons. One area where Kittle has underwhelmed is touchdowns (five each of the past two seasons) and his 10.8 OTD and 13 end zone targets during the span suggest it's not a fluke. Of course, there's still plenty of room to grow in that department, and Kittle has plenty of dominant years left at age 26. He's a fine third-round target.","It doesn't get much more volatile than kickers in fantasy football, but Tucker remains one of the exceptions. The opera-singing superstar has finished no lower than 11th in fantasy points during his eight seasons in the league, which includes four-consecutive top-four finishes. He has accomplished that even with the Ravens ranking 20th in field goal attempts last season (the team's first finish lower than 12th since 2010), though they were first in extra point attempts. Tucker has nailed a league-best 91.3% (168 of 184) of his field goals and a league-best 98.4% (188 of 191) of extra points since 2015. The league's best kicker working in a high-scoring offense, Tucker should be the first kicker drafted.","Butker earned the nickname 'Butt kicker' from his coach Andy Reid during a rookie season in which he finished seventh at the position in fantasy points. He progressed to fifth place in 2018 before pacing the position in total fantasy points and top-10 weeks (11) last season. Butler led the NFL in both attempts (38) and conversions (34) in 2019. In fact, the Chiefs have finished top-nine in field goal attempts in four of the past five seasons. Kansas City's elite offense should help Butker sustain top-end fantasy production.","Metcalf is entering his second NFL season, following an impressive rookie campaign in which he played on 83% of Seattle's snaps and was responsible for 30% of the team's air yards. Metcalf scored seven touchdowns, but was actually unlucky in that department (8.1 OTD), as the Ole Miss product paced the entire NFL in end-zone targets -- his 19 looks were three more than any other player. Metcalf ended the season as fantasy's No. 33 WR, though his role resulted in only one top-12 fantasy week and seven finishes of 40th or worse. Metcalf is only 22 and good bet for a step forward in his second season. Consider him as a WR3 with the upside for a major breakout.","Following a rough start to the 2019 season, Pittsburgh's D/ST went on to finish second in fantasy points, marking the unit's fourth top-eight finish over the past five seasons. Pittsburgh was a big-play machine, ranking no worse than fifth in forced turnovers, yardage allowed and points allowed, as well as first in sacks for the third consecutive season. Other than Javon Hargrave, the entire 2019 defensive core is set to return for 2020. The likes of T.J. Watt, Cameron Heyward and Minkah Fitzpatrick provide this unit with plenty of star power, and youngsters Devin Bush and Terrell Edmunds could add to it this season. The Steelers' D/ST should be one of the first off the board during your draft.","Yet another strong performance from Sean McDermott's defense helped the Bills' D/ST to a second-consecutive top-seven fantasy season in 2019. Buffalo ranked no worse than eighth in interceptions, forced fumbles and points allowed, and was top-three in yardage allowed for the second consecutive season. While Lorenzo Alexander (retirement) will be missed, the Buffalo defense is arguably better after adding Quinton Jefferson, Mario Addison and Josh Norman. Led by the likes of Tre'Davious White, Jordan Poyer, Micah Hyde, Jerry Hughes and emerging youngsters Ed Oliver and Tremaine Edmunds, the Bills' D/ST is arguably your best option in fantasy.","Despite his wide receiver room being absolutely ravaged by injuries, Wentz posted his second career top-10 fantasy campaign in 2019. Volume was the primary reason, as the 27-year-old ranked first in snaps, fifth in pass attempts and seventh in carries among QBs. Wentz dealt with 24 drops (third most) and got very little after the catch for the fourth consecutive season (4.8 RAC). Perhaps most important, Wentz held up, handling 99% of the Eagles' dropbacks before a concussion suffered in the playoffs. Wentz will work behind an elite offensive line and with a solid group of weapons in 2020. He's a back-end QB1.","Mattison enters his second NFL season in the same position he was in as a rookie: Dalvin Cook insurance. The 2019 third-round pick impressed in his first season, producing 544 yards on 110 touches. Mattison averaged 4.6 YPC despite facing an average of 7.3 in-box defenders, highest in the NFL. Mattison is entering his age-22 season without much stand-alone value, but there's no doubt that he would vault to RB1 territory in the event of a Dalvin Cook injury in Minnesota's run-heavy scheme. Draft him, and stash him.","Slowly but surely, Williams' pro career continues to progress. The 2017 first-round pick barely played as a rookie, posting a 43-664-10 receiving line in a situational role in 2018. He followed that up with a 49-1,001-2 line as a full-time player in 2019. Last season, Williams paced the NFL in aDOT (17.3) and YPR (20.4) and ranked fourth in YPT (11.0), but dealt with the worst luck in the league in the touchdown department. Williams posted a 6.9 OTD thanks to 11 end-zone targets (tied for eighth most), but scored only twice. The 25-year-old is a strong bet for more touchdowns, but the departure of Philip Rivers hurts his stock. Williams is a more appealing flex choice in non-PPR leagues.","The Packers did surprisingly little to address a shaky WR situation behind Davante Adams during the offseason, which positions Lazard very well for a sizable 2020 role. The undrafted 2018 free agent first saw extended action in Week 6 last season and went on to average 4.8 targets the rest of the way. That allowed a 35-477-3 receiving line and the 51st-most fantasy points among receivers. Green Bay is expected to lean more on the run this season, but Lazard will only need to fend off the likes of Jake Kumerow and Marquez Valdes-Scantling for snaps. Consider Lazard only in very deep leagues.","","Trubisky is technically atop the Bears' depth chart, but he is no longer assured of Week 1 starting duties following the team's acquisition of Nick Foles. The second overall pick in 2017, Trubisky took a step forward in his second pro season back in 2018 but regressed in nearly every category last season. Despite appearing in 15 games, Trubisky was limited to only three top-10 fantasy weeks and finished 26th in points by season's end. The 25-year-old is barely worth QB2 consideration as a starter, so with Foles lingering, he's obviously well off the fantasy

It helps the rookie's case as a RB1 candidate that Houston allowed the 10th-most fantasy points and 12th-most rushing yards to backfields last season.","With an astounding 76 passing scores in 31 career games, Mahomes is tied with Dan Marino for the most touchdowns through as many games in NFL history. Having orchestrated an incredible comeback against the Texans in last season's playoffs, Mahomes is familiar with dropping big numbers on this shaky Houston pass defense.","Moore had a breakout campaign in 2019, going over 1,100 yards on the year and finding himself as Carolina's top option on offense outside of superstar RB Christian McCaffrey. With Teddy Bridgewater now under center, things certainly won't get any worse for Moore, who saw 135 targets in 2019 and will likely see even more in 2020. He's an easy start as your WR1/WR2 in Week 1 against Las Vegas.","Coach Mike Tomlin told reporters several times this offseason he remains a staunch proponent of leaning on a single featured back versus a committee approach. A steady presence as a three-down threat leads to Conner entering Week 1 with awesome fantasy potential facing a leaky Giants front seven.","Working with a proven veteran quarterback should help Hilton's production pattern. Philip Rivers was able to feed Keenan Allen with consistently valuable looks, aiding Hilton's case to return to WR2 value in what is a sweet opening matchup against a porous Jacksonville pass defense.","Without much competition for valuable vertical or red zone looks in this Jacksonville offense, Chark enters his third season with both a stable floor and a fun fantasy ceiling. The Colts were respectable against the pass last season, but Chark's rewarding role keeps him firmly in the WR3 tier with upside for more.","A high-floor receiving threat given how much of his workload comes on high-percentage, short-area targets, Boyd enters the new season working with a talented young quarterback going up against a stingy Chargers pass defense. Given the difficult opponent, expectations are tempered for this flex option.","Pacing the Patriots by 62 targets last season, Edelman should again prove busy as the top option for the New England passing attack this season. The key difference, of course, is the swap of Tom Brady for Cam Newton behind center, lowering both Edelman's fantasy floor and ceiling in the process. The Dolphins have two capable cover corners after investing in the position over the offseason, but sheer volume of opportunities keeps Edelman in the WR2 discussion.","Once buried behind Mark Andrews in Baltimore, Hurst will now step into the shoes of one of the more prolific tight ends in football (Austin Hooper, who left Atlanta to join the Browns). That leaves the 27-year-old Hurst at the top of the depth chart, and he's shown flashes of the kind of production you want to see out of a solid TE1 in fantasy (30 catches on 39 targets and a pair of scores in 2019). He's a bit too unproven relative to other options for Week 1 purposes, but definitely keep an eye on him.",null,"Garoppolo led the San Francisco offense effectively in his first full season as a starter, but he lacked in fantasy upside given the run-first nature of the team and bit of a turnover problem. He enters 2020 as a bit of a \"matchup play\" with upside for a big game every now and then. That said, even against the team that allowed the most QB fantasy points last season (Arizona), he's hard to trust with a starting spot in Week 1.","Fitzgerald has not missed a game since 2014 and, while he is definitely at the tail-end of his career, he's more than good enough to deserve a look in your fantasy lineup every now and then. That said, the 49ers are a middling matchup for opposing wideouts and Fitzgerald has plenty of competition for catches in Week 1 if everyone is healthy. As such, he's best left on the bench for this one.","Brown handled a decent number of carries last season helping to spell the ailing Todd Gurley II, and now he'll do the same for rookie Cam Akers as he adjusts to the league. It remains to be seen if the Rams will hand the keys to the backfield straight to Akers, or if Brown will get a shot to show what he can do. Still, without a proven track record of success and considering the draft capital invested in Akers, we'd say Brown should be kept on the bench for Week 1 against Dallas.","Watkins opened the 2019 season with an incredible performance only to finish with yet another lackluster overall line. The tantalizing upside is still present given his role in a fun offense and this inviting matchup with Houston, but there is also clear risk in deploying Watkins in lineups to open the season.","In last season's home contest against Arizona, the 49ers D/ST scored a touchdown, secured two fumbles and picked up four sacks. That was a fairly typical week for the unit for the first half of the year, but things definitely dipped toward the end of the season. Either way, this is a good matchup for what should be a solid D/ST all season long."],"2":["Just the third player in Chiefs history with as many as 100 rushing yards in his NFL debut, joining Kareem Hunt and Christian Okoye, Edwards-Helaire impressively broke seven tackles on 25 rushes and netted 4.2 yards after initial contact per touch. If the receiving usage shows up -- and it likely will -- Helaire is poised to sustain RB1 value heading into a meeting with a Chargers defense that claims a retooled linebacking corps.","In becoming the fist player in NFL history with three passing scores and no picks in three consecutive season openers, Mahome moved to 8-0 in his career in September as the Chiefs won their 10th straight game. Per this week's matchup, last season, the Chargers played zone at a league-high 68% of opponent dropbacks. Mahomes, meanwhile, ranked tops in the league in QBR facing zone last season.","Mooreâ€™s first week with Teddy Bridgewater under center was uneventful, as he caught just four balls on nine targets, for a modest 54 yards. Against an inexperienced Raiders secondary, Teddy Bridgewater was able to spread things around. The Panthers face another young set of defensive backs in Week 2, though the Buccaneers held Drew Brees to just 160 yards in the air. Moore should improve on last weekâ€™s output, remaining a borderline fantasy WR1.","James Conner left with an ankle injury in the second quarter and never returned to the field. Dubbed the clear every-down back to start the game, Conner would cede most of his touches to Benny Snell if he misses this outing against the Broncos. If active, there is real potential for a solid showing based on volume alone.","Rookie corner C.J. Henderson gave Hilton some trouble in Week 1, leaving Parris Campbell with the most promising usage profile in the opener. There is still very real potential for Hilton to deliver strong results given an expectation for a 20% target share  against a Vikings defense that could struggle in coverage.","You probably sing his name to the Baby Shark melody over and over, don't you? No matter how you celebrate managing Mr. Chark, it was nice to see him pace the Jaguars by a good margin in routes in Week 1. This week offers some real upside given the Titans' biggest weakness on defense is arguably at outside corner. ","With fewer than 40 total air yards and just five targets in Week 1, a tough matchup and Joe Burrow's rookie struggles combined to deliver a weak opener for Boyd. With a friendlier matchup next, Boyd's in a more promising position to produce flex-worthy results.","It's nearly a victory for Edelman to have grinded out 57 yards in his first game working with Cam Newton, as there were only 19 dropbacks in the contest for New England. A chain-moving force for the Patriots, Edelman should sustain value from a flex spot for fantasy managers ahead of an inviting matchup with the Seattle secondary.","Hurst's first game with his new team was mediocre, as he only saw five targets and three receptions. He should be more involved in Week 2 as the Cowboys defense allowed a league-leading 104 catches to tight ends last season, though Dallas held the tight ends on the Rams to just four catches in Week 1. Hurst is in play Week 2 for leagues with 12-plus teams.",null,"Garoppolo's trademark 2019 efficiency was lacking in Week 1 against the Cardinals, as he completed only 57.6% of his passes to open the season. The San Francisco quarterback is tough to trust in fantasy, given the team's run-first nature. However, that's even more true if he's not being as efficient as possible. Keep him sidelined in fantasy for Week 2.","Through one week, it's apparent that the veteran receiver isn't going anywhere. He finished with the second-most receptions among Cardinals in Week 1, and now takes on a much weaker defense in Week 2. Washington might have surprised folks in Week 1, but this is a team that allowed an above-average amount of points to wideouts last season. Fitzgerald is a low-ceiling flex pick in deeper leagues for as long as he's a regular part of this Arizona offense.","Brown had a fantastic 2020 debut as the full-time starter for the Rams, touching the ball 21 times, scoring twice and going over 100 total yards. His days as a part-time backup to Todd Gurley II are over, and he doesn't seem ready to cede his playing time to the backups. He's a solid option as your RB2 heading into Week 2 against the Eagles, who may have a solid run defense, but did allow a pair of rushing touchdowns in Week 1.","Watkins led the Chiefs in targets in what was a quick-hitting, if not vertical, game plan for the Kansas City passing scheme. It's unlikely Watkins will claim such a robust target clip, and a tough matchup with the capable Chargers corners results in risky fantasy stock.","The 49ers have one of the more talented defenses in the league and were among the top D/ST options in 2019, but they struggled out of the gate against an upgraded Arizona offense. A matchup with the Jets should set things right, so you can trust in San Francisco as your D/ST for Week 2."],"3":["A sluggish day on the ground was countered by increased involvement in the Chiefs' passing game for the gifted rookie this past week. The Ravens have been solid against backs in both phases, but sheer volume and potential for valuable touches supports RB1 status for the hyped hyphenated rookie.","For those of you in leagues that track player speed, it helps to note that Mahomes was running at a speed of 11.2 MPH and threw the ball 52.9 yards of air distance (point of throw to catch) on his 54-yard TD to Tyreek Hill in Week 2. Mahomes also added six scrambles for 54 yards and four first downs, matching a career high for rushing first downs in a game. The magical signal-caller might need to flash more tricks against Baltimore's capable defense this Monday.","After a lackluster opening week, Moore garnered 120 yards on eight catches (13 targets). While his 29% target share is encouraging, Moore's 55% catch rate suggests he and Teddy Bridgewater have some timing issues. Moore now faces a Chargers secondary that kept the prolific Chiefs offense in check until late in last week's game. Still, he should receive ample looks to be a solid WR2 in Week 3.","Entering the week there was doubt about whether Conner was still the leading force in this Pittsburgh backfield. Eighteen touches and 121 scrimmage yards later, it's clear that Conner is still the main man for the Steelers heading into this choice matchup with the Texans' porous rush defense. ","A catch rate of just 50% is likely due to the fact Hilton is averaging a robust 14.3 air yards per target. Due for a positive correction in production given healthy opportunity rates through two weeks, Hilton is positioned for a solid showing against a Jets defense allowing 36 fantasy points per game to receivers.","While it would have been nice to see Chark net more than four targets in Week 2, it remains encouraging that he's getting dealt the ball down the field, as his average depth of target of 17.3 yards led the team this past Sunday. As the team's best vertical playmaker, Chark enters this matchup with Miami as a solid flex candidate in all formats.","A return to his steady ways was refreshing for investors, as Boyd delivered a solid line in the loss to the Browns. The Eagles have struggled to contain slot receivers this season, aiding Boyd's upside.","An awesome aDOT (averaged depth of target) of 15.8 yards led to a career yardage showing from Edelman. The transition from Tom Brady to Cam Newton hasn't ruined Edelman's fantasy stock, if anything his ceiling is higher heading into this meeting with an exploitable Raiders pass defense.","After an opening week where Hurst was mainly a safety valve, the former Raven was more involved in Week 2, with several downfield looks (including a 42-yard reception) among his five grabs. Hurst could be in line for another productive week as the opposing Bears clamp down on wideouts but have been more generous to tight ends, surrendering 13 catches for 120 yards in two games. With so many other options, Hurst's upside is capped. Still, his volume keeps him as a streaming candidate.",null,"It seems unlikely that Garoppolo will play in Week 2 after suffering a high-ankle sprain. Even if he does recover, he's not a reliable fantasy starter anyway. Look elsewhere for your Week 3 quarterback.","The veteran receiver made a bit of a splash in Week 2, hauling in seven passes and playing on a healthy 61 snaps on offense. Yet, with DeAndre Hopkins leading Arizona's pass-catching corps and Kyler Murray providing production with his running, Fitzgerald and teammate Christian Kirk are left to split a small share of the Cardinals offense. Neither is a great option this week, but in a great matchup with the Lions, they can both be  considered as low-end flex picks.","Injuries will impact the Rams backfield in Week 3, as Brown is dealing with a broken finger and Cam Akers has separated rib cartilage. With both players dealing with ailments over the weekend, Darrell Henderson Jr. stepped up and had a huge game -- after previously seeming like the clear No. 3 man on the RB depth chart. Brown still appears to be the starter, but the combination of a minor injury and the performance of Henderson means he's a very risky flex play, at best, in Week 3 against the Bills.","Down to just three targets and 22 air yards in Week 2 after netting nine looks and roughly 100 air yards in Week 1, Watkins isn't a weekly threat to produce helpful numbers, but rather a boom-or-bust option ideal for DFS or deeper leagues. Baltimore has been solid in allowing the fewest fantasy points to receivers among AFC teams this season, further limiting the appeal with Watkins.","After a tough Week 1 against a very talented Arizona offense, the 49ers settled in with a solid showing against the Jets in Week 2. Expect more of the same as they stay in the Meadowlands for a matchup with the Giants. You can safely start this unit as your D/ST in all leagues."],"4":["With 25 touches in yet another outings, this rare rookie has a firm grip on work as both a rusher and a receiver in the league's most dangerous offense. The Patriots have weakened against the run compared to last season and have yielded 100 rushing yards per game to tailbacks thus far. With Edwards-Helaire consuming so many touches each week, it's easy to start him in all formats.","Now with two Monday Night Football games with at least five total touchdowns, Mahomes next looks to take down the Patriots. The New England pass defense isn't nearly as stingy this season compared to last season's rates, while Mahomes' incomparable scoring upside keeps him in the must-start tier of passers.","Week 3 was a quiet one as Teddy Bridgewater put the ball in the air only 28 times, four of which went Moore's way. He reeled in two balls for a team-high 65 yards. Moore draws the Cardinals in Week 4, a top-10 pass defense through three weeks. Even so, Moore remains one of Bridgewater's favorite targets, so he's still a solid WR2.","This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","Now up to 14 straight games with fewer than 100 receiving yards dating back to 2018, the longest such stretch of his career, Hilton also now has eight straight games without a touchdown. Due for some bigger plays given his blend of routes and air yards, Hilton faces a Chicago secondary allowing the ninth-most yards per game to wideouts. ","Still dealing with chest and back ailments, Chark would emerge as a solid WR2 candidate against an exploitable tandem of corners for Cincinnati. If he's ready to go, Chark's blend of downfield usage and solid matchup helps his case as a fantasy starter.","A gaudy 13 targets fueled a big Week 3 showing in South Philly for Boyd, as the Pitt product netted 10 catches in a strong showing. The Jaguars have some issues in coverage from the slot, which aids Boyd's relatively stable floor and his case as a high-end WR2 candidate.","While he didn't have any success connecting with Cam Newton after a career outing in Week 2, it's helpful to note Edelman's average depth of target remained healthy at 12.1 air yards in Week 3. Per this upcoming AFC showdown, the Chiefs have been outright stingy against receivers, but Edelman's steady slice of the passing game helps support WR2 expectations.","The good news is that Hurst appears to be a regular red-zone target for Matt Ryan, securing TD catches in each of the last two weeks. However, Sunday's score was the only pass sent in Hurst's direction. Another quiet game is possible as the Packers are allowing fewer than four catches (and for under 50 yards a game) to tight ends. Still, with the potential for Hurst to find paydirt, he's still worth a flier in most leagues.",null,"Even if Garoppolo is able to return to action in Week 4 against the Eagles, it's hard to trust him as your starter in fantasy. He has his moments of brilliance, but too often San Francisco leans quite heavily on the running game and does not allow Garoppolo to rack up the fantasy points. The Eagles have allowed the 11th-fewest QB fantasy points this season, so you can avoid this situation altogether in favor of better matchups.","In Week 3, Fitzgerald did not see a boost in opportunities with Christian Kirk out. In fact, his targets actually decreased against the Lions. That's not a great sign heading into Week 4, when we'd want to see the veteran poised for a heavy workload to merit a start against a middle-of-the-pack Carolina defense. Keep him on the bench for now.","Brown played on as many snaps as Darrell Henderson Jr. in Week 3, but Henderson saw the bulk of the touches, leaving the more experienced back as the No. 2 option. The Giants provide a decent matchup for opposing backs, but it is Henderson, and not Brown,who is the Los Angeles \"back to look to\" in fantasy for Week 4.","In the two weeks Watkins has played a full game, he's netted 17 targets and proven integral to the offense. The Patriots haven't been elite against the pass just yet, but have deep personnel in the secondary and make for a difficult matchup. It's safe to assume Watkins is just outside flex territory for now.","After a slow start to the season against a Cardinals offense that has given them issues in the past, the 49ers are back to their dominant ways as a D/ST. With only 22 scoreboard points allowed over the past two games, trust them as a solid pick in Week 4 against an Eagles offense leading the league in giveaways."],"5":["Churning out 91 scrimmage yards on 19 touches against a solid New England defense supports the premise that this rookie has one of the higher fantasy floors at his position. Next up is a choice matchup with a Raiders defense allowing the most fantasy points per game to backfields.","The Chiefs host the Raiders in Week 5, as Mahomes looks to continue his dominance in divisional games. Mahomes is 13-1 in his career against the AFC West with 29 touchdown passes and six interceptions in those games. Elias confirms Mahomes can become the first quarterback to debut since 1970 to win 14 of his first 15 divisional starts. Start and enjoy.","Other than a solid Week 2 effort against the Buccaneers, Moore has been one of the bigger disappointments through the first four games, surpassing 65 yards just once and without catching a scoring strike all season. The script should flip this week as Moore draws a weak Falcons secondary. Look for Moore to get back on track with WR2 production.","Averaging nearly 96 scrimmage yards in his three outings this season, Conner has reclaimed his perch as Pittsburgh's unquestioned feature back. The Eagles present a real challenge in that they are among the stingiest teams against the rush early this season. With a very real path to 20 touches, though, Conner's value remains high heading into Week 5.","Now with 15 consecutive games with fewer than 100 receiving yards, Hilton also hasn't had a touchdown in nine straight. With just 27 total air yards on three targets last week, there really just haven't been many opportunities to break out for Hilton this year. If Hilton is ever going to explode with a huge line, it's in a matchup like this week against a Browns secondary allowing 211 yards per game to receivers, most in the conference.","Chark bounced back from injury to rack up a pair of touchdowns in Week 4, hauling in more catches and seeing more targets than in his first two games combined. This is a great sign for the receiver moving forward, but with a decent Houston defense coming up in Week 5, don't expect an even bigger performance. Instead, consider Chark as a solid WR3/top-end flex pick against the Texans.","Leading the team with eight targets in Week 4, Boyd delivered another high-floor fantasy outcome for managers. Baltimore rates roughly league average against receivers in regards to fantasy points allowed, while Boyd's success out of the slot aids his floor for this division matchup. ","The game between the Patriots and the Broncos has been postponed. Both teams will be on a bye for Week 5.","Hurst posted a workmanlike four grabs for 51 yards in Monday night's loss to Green Bay, though he failed to score for the first time in three weeks. Hurst's floor is solid though his potential for a big game this week is tempered facing a Panthers unit among the best at defending tight ends. Since floor is more important than ceiling at the position, Hurst is in play as a streaming option.",null,"A matchup with Miami looms for the 49ers, which would be great for Garoppolo and the passing game -- if he's healthy. Should the San Francisco signal-caller start, consider him as a low-end QB1 against a defense that's allowed the fourth-most points per game to the position so far this season. Just make sure to keep a close eye on the injury reports headed into the weekend.","Christian Kirk returned to action in Week 4, which helped limit Fitzgerald to only three targets for the second straight week. The veteran has four receiving yards over the past two games and does not appear to be a big enough factor in the Arizona offense to merit a start in fantasy for Week 5.","Brown led Los Angeles backs in both rushing attempts and targets in Week 4, but by slim margins. After Darrell Henderson Jr. had a breakout outing the week prior, things returned to more of a 50/50 split against the Giants, which does not bode well moving forward. If Cam Akers returns, all three players carry a lot of risk against Washington. Even if Akers sits again, Brown is a risky flex play at best.","Regularly pacing the Chiefs in targets is likely a good sign for Watkins' profile; he's quietly tied for second on the team in catches and is third in receiving yardage. The Raiders have been respectable against the pass, but Watkins' steady presence in a top offense is enough to trust him as a flex.","The 49ers are good on both defense and special teams. Coming to town in Week 5 are the Dolphins, who have turned the ball over five times already this season with an error-prone Ryan Fitzpatrick under center. Look for this unit to key in on the veteran and have a big day -- one that is worthy of a D/ST start in all fantasy leagues."],"6":["Possibly as an homage to how Las Vegas deploys Josh Jacobs, Edwards-Helaire didn't see the field for a single third-down snap in Week 5. This means the rookie ceded valuable snaps and touches to Darrel Williams, including two plays at the goal line.Â Even in a wonky game that saw him net just 13 touches, the rookie was still targeted seven times and should rebound nicely against a Bills team that rates right around league average against the run.","Pressure brought out the best of Mahomes in Week 5, at least from a fantasy perspective; the signal-caller set a season high in fantasy points despite suffering a loss to the Raiders. Mahomes was pressured on 29 of his dropbacks against Las Vegas, the second most pressures he's ever faced in an NFL game. The Bills and their blitz-heavy defense are next on the schedule for Mahomes, but we already know he can produce big numbers against pressure.","In Week 5, Moore capped off a decent day with his first TD catch, compiling 93 yards on four grabs. The performance is encouraging as Moore's targets have been down while his drop percentage has risen. Drafted as a WR1/WR2, Moore's usage in the Carolina passing game has fallen behind both Robby Anderson and Mike Davis. Still, he's a high-end WR3 in Week 6 against a formidable Bears secondary.","The Steelers couldn't get their offense going on the ground against Philadelphia's solid interior line, but Conner confirmed his valuable fantasy role with a touchdown in a goal-to-go scenario and some respectable receiving usage. Cleveland has been solid in defending the run, allowing the seventh-fewest yards per carry (3.7) to tailbacks. A similar blend of high-leverage red zone touches and rewarding receiving opportunities should help Conner once again deliver for his fantasy investors.","The bad news is that Hilton just posted his 16th consecutive game without 100 yards. For some context, his last touchdown came from Andrew Luck. It's also not great that Hilton dropped what would have surely been a touchdown in the red zone against the Browns this past Sunday. The good news is that after playing fewer than 60% of the Colts' snaps in three of the prior four outings, Hilton was only off the field for five percent of the team's plays this past week and led the team in targets by a wide margin.","Prior to exiting Week 5's contest in Houston with an ankle injury, Chark had caught three balls for 16 yards. The third-year wideout is questionable for this week's home encounter with the Lions. Chark is capable of putting up big numbers in any given week, but his inconsistency and a chance that he reamins a bit hobbled lands him in WR3/flex territory in Week 6.","With A.J. Green sidelined in the second half of Week 5, Boyd delivered a modest yardage total. Then again, the Bengals were still committed to the run down big in a likely effort to spare their rookie passer from too many hits via Baltimore's blitz. With what should be a healthy target share this week, Boyd remains a high-floor WR3 facing a solid Colts pass defense.","Not having Cam Newton behind center appeared to cost Edelman's production in Week 4; he failed to see any solid vertical chances against the Chiefs. With the team likely still struggling to field a good quarterback this week, Edelman is a WR2 candidate due to Denver's suspect pass defense metrics.","Despite an increase in his average depth of target since joining the Falcons, Hurst's catch and yardage totals remain modest as he and Matt Ryan continue to try and develop chemistry. With six targets in four of Atlanta's five games, Hurst is definitely involved in the Atlanta offense. That said, Week 6 in Minnesota doesn't portend to a breakout as tight end is the one position the Vikings defend better than average. Even so, Hurst is a low-end TE1, but it's worth investigating to see if there's a better streaming option.",null,"Garoppolo did not finish his Week 5 start against Miami, struggling with a pair of interceptions and making way for C.J. Beathard. However, it wasn't a true benching, and seems to be more an attempt to protect the still-hurting ankle of the San Francisco signal-caller. The Rams pose a very tough challenge for opposing passers in fantasy (seventh-fewest QB fantasy points per game allowed) so, even if Garoppolo starts for the 49ers, he shouldn't start for your fantasy squad.","Fitzgerald remains a key fixture in the Arizona offense, but not quite as key as high-volume players like Kenyan Drake and DeAndre Hopkins. The veteran receiver has not shown any big-play potential this season, and Christian Kirk outperformed him in Week 5. Looking ahead, Fitzgerald is best left on the bench against the Cowboys.","Brown rushed only eight times for 30 yards in Week 5, and handled only a single reception, all of which resulted in a loss. This backfield is far too crowded to trust any of the bunch with your fantasy matchups each week. If you have to pick one, Darrell Henderson Jr. is the one producing the best point totals at the moment. Especially against a tough San Francisco defense, steer clear of Brown in Week 6.","A hamstring injury suffered in Week 5 against the Raiders is expected to cost Watkins multiple games, per ESPN's Adam Schefter. Even if he's somehow able to go, Watkins would be a risky option given the recurrent nature of his injury.","The 49ers D/ST was off to a solid start, as expected, but Week 5 brought with it an embarrassing defeat at the hands of the Dolphins. We have every reason to expect this team to bounce back to the unit that had scored six-plus fantasy points per game in Weeks 2-4. Still, you'd be forgiven for seeking other Week 6 options after San Francisco allowed 43 scoreboard points to Miami and forced no turnovers last week."],"7":["Second in the NFL in yards after contact as a rusher and thriving as the team's early-down option, Edwards-Helaire now faces real competition for meaningful touches with Le'Veon Bell in town. The early expectation for this share is for the rookie to enjoy a majority share of touches, keeping him in the flex tier among backs for this matchup against a Denver defense yielding just the third-fewest fantasy points per game to backs.","The Chiefs have won nine straight against Denver and Mahomes is undefeated in five matchups against the Broncos in his career. Making it six straight won't be so easy given how well Denver's pass rush played last week, but it helps Mahomes' chances that the Broncos have allowed 20.6 fantasy points per game to quarterbacks on the year.","In Week 6, Teddy Bridgewater targeted Moore a team-high 11 times, but since the signal-caller was hurried all day, they connected on just five of those passes, albeit for 93 yards. This was the second straight week where Moore registered that total, but he was unable to find the end zone this time around. Moore has a good chance to return to the scoring column in Week 7 as the Saints have surrendered three WR scoring strikes per game. Cosinder Moore to be in WR2/WR3 territory.","This past Sunday marked the rare instance where the Steelers' rushing offense was more efficient on a per-play basis than the passing phase. This speaks well of Conner's production, as the every-down force handled 21 touches at nearly five yards per touch. The Titans, meanwhile, are one of just six teams allowing at least five yards per carry to tailbacks this season. One of the rare 20-touch backs in the league, Conner has a real shot at RB1 production.",null,"Gardner Minshew's misfires cost Chark some real yardage in Week 6, but it was still impressive to see the receiver consume a massive workload with 14 targets. The Chargers present a big challenge with a strong secondary, but assuming he's a bit healthier this week, Chark's awesome target share supports flex value.","The story remains the same with Boyd; he claims a high floor for yards and catches each week, but a decidedly low ceiling, as well. A lack of big plays and more competition for meaningful targets with the rise of Tee Higgins leaves Boyd in the WR3 tier ahead of this inviting matchup with the Browns' depleted secondary.","In one of his uglier showings in recent seasons, Edelman finished Week 6 just third on the team in routes run and caught just two of his six looks from Cam Newton. The 49ers haven't been kind to receivers this season in yielding the sixth-fewest fantasy points, but a high target rate can help Edelman deliver flex value.","In Week 6, Hurst benefited from a healthy Julio Jones and an upright Matt Ryan, securing all four of his targets for 57 yards and his third score of the campaign. Week 7 presents a tough matchup as the visiting Lions have held opposing tight ends to the second-fewest points per game in the league. Even though Hurst was drafted to be a TE1, this is a week to see if there's someone available with a better matchup.",null,"Garoppolo rebounded from injury and a disappointing outing against the Dolphins with three TD passes against the Rams in Week 6. It was his best performance of the season and is a big boost to the 49ers offense. That said, he has a tough matchup ahead with the Patriots, who have allowed the sixth-fewest QB fantasy points per game this season. Garoppolo lacks upside as a fantasy quarterback, so he can be left on the bench for Week 7.","The veteran led the Cardinals in catches on Monday night â€¦ with three. Kyler Murray was way more inaccurate than usual, and Arizona raced out to an early lead which allowed them to run the ball late to put the game away. Fitzgerald certainly remains a part of the Arizona passing game, but lacks the volume of DeAndre Hopkins and the big-play ability of Christian Kirk. As such, even in a great matchup with Seattle, he's best left on the bench.","Brown handled a season-low two carries against the 49ers in Week 6 and appears to have fully ceded the starting RB role to Darrell Henderson Jr. He will still have a role on passing downs (four targets against San Francisco) but is not going to be a reliable source of fantasy points moving forward unless he earns that starting job back.",null,"After an embarrassing defeat at the hands of the Dolphins in Week 5, the 49ers rebounded with a decent effort against the Rams. Unfortunately, the D/ST wasn't the reason for the success. With no sacks and only one takeaway, San Francisco's D/ST now has back-to-back clunkers against mediocre offenses. New England is up next. While the Patriots are no longer a team that should scare you off of the 49ers as a D/ST option, consider recent performances and look for another unit if you're worried about the downward trend."],"8":["On one hand, Edwards-Helaire scored his first rushing touchdown since Week 1 this past Sunday. On the other, nearly evenly split snaps, routes, and touches with Le'Veon Bell. If he's still the alpha option in red zone scenarios, this rookie remains a valuable RB2, but it will be compelling to see how this share plays out in a choice matchup with the Jets.","The Chiefs opened as 22-point favorites over the Jets this week, marking the 10th time since the merger for a spread this large. For some perspective on how these franchises are respectively doing, Mahomes has delivered 92 passing touchdowns in 38 career games, while the Jets has tallied 91 passing scores in their 77 games. This one should be fun for Mahomes and his fantasy investors.","In Week 7, buoyed by a 74-yard TD reception, Moore recorded 93 receiving yards for the third straight week. He scored on a 7-yard pass as well, making the most of his four grabs. Moore lines up for another big game when the Panthers host the Falcons and one of the most generous secondaries in the league on Thursday night.","With at least 18 touches in four straight gamesÂ and valuable touches in goal-to-go and red zone scenarios, Conner is one of the rare bankable weekly backs in the league. The Ravens have not been a nice matchup for backs in allowing the seventh-fewest fantasy points per game to the position, but Conner's big workload supports a fairly high floor.","It was not a good sign to see Hilton reel in a single catch against the Bengals a few weeks back even as Philip Rivers enjoyed a breakout game. Hilton was on the field plenty in the game, leaving the field for just four plays, so it's a bit troubling to consider how low the floor can prove. This said, Detroit has yielded the seventh-most fantasy points to receivers, so there is something to like about Hilton's prospects.",null,"Found at eighth in the NFL in targets, Boyd is fresh from a signature PPR outbreak having caught all but two of his 13 targets in Week 7. As the resident chain-mover for Joe Burrow, Boyd should again prove busy facing a soft secondary allowing the fourth-most fantasy points per game to receivers. ","Edelman may be out for a number of weeks due to a \"bone-on-bone\" injury.","Hurst caught a season-high six balls for 68 yards in Week 7's frustrating 23-22 loss to Detroit. Hurst's seven targets marked the fifth time in seven games he has garnered at least five looks, but he's still embedded in the matchup tier. Unfortunately, Thursday night is unfavorable as the Panthers have held tight ends to the third-fewest points per game in the league.",null,"In Week 7, Garoppolo failed to score while tossing a pair of interceptions (although one was on a half-ending desperation end-zone heave), resulting in a poor fantasy outing. However, that was against a stalwart New England defense. Week 8 brings a matchup with the rival Seahawks. Seattle allows the highest per-game average of QB fantasy points, meaning Garoppolo is in the mix as a streaming starter in all leagues if you need a one-week replacement at the position.",null,"After handling a season-low two carries against the 49ers in Week 6, Brown rebounded in a big way, racking up 10 touches and scoring against the Bears on Monday night. Darrell Henderson Jr. was the lead back, but Brown kept a decent chunk of playing time and touches for himself and remains a factor on the Rams offense. That said, his presence diminishes the fantasy value for Henderson a bit while not delivering a lot of upside of his own. As such, even against a weak Miami defense, it's best to avoid Brown this week.",null,"The 49ers will face one of the best offenses in football in Week 8, as they head to Seattle. The Seahawks look to give this unit the toughest test it's faced since Week 1 against Arizona. If you have the San Francisco defense, have faith and keep them in your lineup due to their incredible turnover potential. All that said, don't be afraid to jump to a better option if one emerges on your waiver wire."],"9":["Well, that wasn't very fun. Le'Veon Bell and Edwards-Helaire essentially split work down the middle last week against the Jets, with neither cashing in on the touchdown party. Given the share for work between these two backs, the rookie is found in the RB2 for this meeting with the Panthers, especially as Carolina has allowed the fourth-most fantasy points per game to backfields.","The Chiefs' prolific downfield passing attack was firing on all cylinders this past week, as three of Mahomes' five scores came on throws of at least 25 yards. With playmakers at every level and real momentum entering this matchup with the Panthers, Mahomes is once again the safest play at the position.Â ","Through three quarters of Week 8's Thursday action, Moore was looking at a goose egg, but he grabbed two balls for 55 yards down the stretch. The third-year wideout should be busier this week as the Panthers will need to keep pace with the Chiefs' prolific offense. Look for an improved effort, somewhere in the WR2/WR3 range.","Another week with 18 touches and a touchdown is all part of the value Conner's consistent usage helps support. There are few backs with a more projectable role than Conner each week, a fact that works strongly in his favor this week against a Dallas defense that has allowed nearly 25 fantasy points per game to backfields.","A groin injury saw Hilton leave the field early in Week 8. It was seemingly another quiet showing for Hilton before leaving the field before the half and enters this difficult matchup against a stingy Baltimore defense in a bad spot in regards to fantasy value. No longer the trustworthy playmaker of his prime, Hilton isn't in a good position to exceed his projection.","In the two weeks prior to the Jaguars' bye, Chark and Gardner Minshew connected on just 8-of-21 targets, including only one catch on seven looks in Week 7. Coming out of the Week 8 bye, Chark will now be on the receiving end of rookie Josh Luton's spirals against a Houston defense allowing the sixth-most WR fantasy points. Look for Chark to rebound as he checks in as a WR2/WR3 for Sunday's contest.",null,"Out indefinitely due to knee surgery, it's time to look for other option than Edelman this season.","Hurst turned in his third straight solid performance in Week 8's Thursday affair, solidifying his status as a reliable fantasy tight end at a position where a solid floor is comforting. Hurst hauled in 5-of-7 looks for 54 yards. This week, Hurst will face a Broncos defense that ranks mid-pack in defending tight ends, putting him in line for another productive game come Sunday.",null,"The 49ers will hand the keys to the offense to Nick Mullens for Week 9 as Garoppolo continues to struggle with an ankle injury suffered weeks ago.","The veteran wideout handled a season-high eight targets against Seattle before Arizona's bye and caught each one of them, setting season-highs in every category he could. He's yet to find the end zone, however, and lacks the consistent volume or scoring threat to be a viable option for your fantasy lineups in Week 9 against Miami.",null,null,"A matchup with Seattle was always going to be tough, even for a talented defense like this one. Will they rebound in Week 9? A game against the Packers means probably not. Aaron Rodgers has been very careful with the ball this season and Green Bay is more than capable of posting a big number on the scoreboard to leave the 49ers in the negatives in terms of fantasy scoring."],"11":["With just 19 carries across his past three appearances and legitimate competition for high-value touches from Le'Veon Bell, it's safe to consider Edwards-Helaire as either an RB2 candidate or a high-end flex play given his still-valuable role for a top offense. The Raiders have allowed the ninth-most yards per carry to tailbacks this season, setting up the rookie with a fairly fun ceiling.  ","The Chiefs lost to the Raiders in Week 5 in a game that saw Patrick Mahomes post his lowest completion percentage in his career at just 51%. Not only does Mahomes have revenge on the mind, he's also riding a streak of four straight primetime games with multiple scores and no interceptions, which is just one game shy of tying the post-merger record for such performances. With a marquee matchup against the rival Raiders on deck, Mahomes is arguably the top play at his position.","Moore outpaced all other Carolina wideouts in the Panthers' Week 10 loss to the Buccaneers with four grabs for 96 yards and a score. Moore lines up for another solid week as Detroit visits in Week 11. His volume may be lower in 2020 than it was last season, but his YPC is up, leaving Moore in WR2 territory against a tame Lions defense.","It's been ugly for two weeks now with Conner struggling to get untracked on the ground as the offense thrives via the pass. The good news is the team still appears firmly committed to feeding Conner the ball heavily on early downs, setting him up as a solid play against a Jacksonville defense allowing the sixth-most fantasy points per game to backfields.","Topping out at 69 yards in a game this season and with just seven catches during his past three outings, Hilton is far removed from his days as a fantasy force. Next facing a Packers defense allowing the seventh-fewest yards per game and the eighth-fewest fantasy points per game to receivers, Hilton isn't in a promising position this week.","Chark followed up Week 9's 147-yard explosion with a modest 4-reception, 56-yard effort as the Jaguars fell to the Packers in Week 10. The team's leading receiver measures up as a flex play when Jacksonville hosts Pittsburgh in Week 11. The Steelers have allowed the 10th-most WR fantasy points per game in the NFL.","Netting just 6.8 yards per reception against the Steelers this past Sunday, Boyd's fantasy line was relatively quiet in the difficult matchup. This next matchup isn't ideal, either, as Washington has limited the production of opposing receivers, but maybe Boyd's unique success in the slot could help deliver another high-floor showing for the target magnet.",null,"Hurst set season-highs in both targets and catches in Week 8, securing 7-of-8 Matt Ryan spirals the last time the Falcons took the field. The pair have a great chance to keep connecting in Week 10 against New Orleans as the Saints have yielded the sixth-most TE fantasy points per game.",null,null,"With two catches for 13 yards in the Cardinals' Week 10 victory over the Bills, Fitzgerald posted his lowest output since Week 4. While it's remarkable that Fitzgerald can still contribute at 37 years old, his production isn't worthy of fantasy consideration, even against a Seahawks secondary which has allowed -- by far -- the most WR fantasy points per game.","Brown may be in a \"running back by committee,\" but it certainly helps his case that he is the Rams' goal-line option. In Week 10, Brown carried the ball just six times, but two of those were TD plunges. Red-zone chances may be limited when the Rams face the Buccaneers on Monday night in Week 11, landing Brown as no more than a flex play in the deepest of formats.","Participation in practice recently and the team's bye week could mean Watkins returns to action from a serious hamstring injury for the first time in several weeks. Likely to serve as a field-stretching force for the Chiefs, the floor is fairly low for the veteran wideout, although the matchup and his big-play potential make for a fun angle in daily play or deeper leagues.",null],"12":["While he just enjoyed his first multi-score game of his career, Edwards-Helaire is sharing enough touches with Le'Veon Bell to lower his fantasy floor to the flex tier of backs this week. Facing the league's top rush defense creates additional risk, but at least this rookie is tied to an elite offense. ","Mahomes has a 98 QBR when blitzed this season, the highest rate by any QB in a season since 2006, when QBR was first tracked. This is likely why he's been blitzed at the second-lowest rate in the league (20%). Tampa Bay, meanwhile, sends extra pass rushers at the second-highest rate in the league. This should be fun. ","It didn't take Moore and fill-in QB P.J. Walker long to get on the same page. They connected twice in a first-quarter scoring drive, one of which went for a long 52-yard gain. Overall in Week 11, Moore secured 7-of-11 targets for a season-high 127 yards, along with a rush for 27 yards. Moore has now strung together two productive games, with a strong chance at a third this week when Carolina visits the Vikings and the seventh-most generous secondary in terms of WR fantasy points allowed per game.","While he didn't get into the end zone against the Jaguars this past week, it's encouraging that Conner averaged 6.2 yards per touch in the contest. The Ravens held Conner to just 3.1 yards per carry in a Week 8 meeting, but this Pitt product is still a fine flex in this matchup given such a consistently strong workload.","Feilding just 13 targets across his past three games and without a touchdown on the season, Hilton's statistical slumber continued this past weekend against the Packers. The Titans just held Hilton to eight fantasy points two weeks ago, right in line with his modest projection for Week 12.","For the sixth time this season, Chark was held to fewer than 60 yards. The Steelers have been particularly tough on passing games, so it's likely we see a stronger line from him this week against a Browns defense allowing nearly 40 fantasy points per game to receiving corps.","The lone productive skill player from Week 11's ugly offensive outing for Cincinnati, Boyd paced the team in targets and scrimmage yards in the loss to the Colts. The Bengals' offense is likely going to deflate a good bit with the transition from Joe Burrow to Ryan Finley, but Boyd's high-volume role out of the slot merits trust in lineups against a porous Giants pass defense. ",null,"After averaging five catches for 60 yards over the past four games, Hurst was shut out in Week 11, unable to secure his only target. Unless you're one of the NFL's truly elite tight ends, games like this are bound to happen. Shake it off! Hurst is still a low-end TE1 when the Falcons welcome the Raiders to Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Sunday.",null,null,"Fitzgerald stepped up to bolster the Arizona offense in a Week 11 loss to Seattle, but don't be tricked into expecting more out of him moving forward. He still managed only 62 yards on 10 targets and has yet to score a touchdown this season. Against a tougher New England defense in Week 12, he's a no-go in fantasy.","Against a tough Tampa Bay defense, Brown could not repeat his 2-TD performance from Week 10. This is even more evidence for keeping all of the Rams' backs out of your fantasy lineup. Los Angeles is spreading out carries and passing-game opportunities across three backs, leaving all of the trio short of the preferred volume for a starter in fantasy. Against a tough 49ers defense, keep Brown on the fantasy sidelines this week.","The Chiefs seem to expect Watkins to finally return to action this week after missing several weeks with hamstring and calf injuries. The upside is always luring, but the floor is also dangerously low for this oft-injured vet heading into this matchup with Tampa Bay.","The last time these teams met, the 49ers shut down the Rams and posted a solid D/ST outing thanks in part to only 16 scoreboard points allowed. However, these two teams seem to have headed in opposite directions since then -- to the point where the Rams would be the better D/ST option of the two for your fantasy squad this week."],"13":["The Chiefs simply didn't need to run the ball to move the chains or sustain drives in Week 12, as the team's elite passing phase went ballistic on the Tampa Bay's secondary. Limited to a 60% share of work now that Le'Veon Bell is firmly entrenched in the offense, Edwards-Helaire is a high-end flex or borderline RB2 if for his scoring potential against the rival Broncos.","Another week and another absurd stat line for Mahomes, who produced 359 passing yards in just the first half against the Buccaneers last week, the most first-half passing yards by any player in a regular-season game over the past 40 years. When Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs host the Broncos on Sunday night, Mahomes will have a chance to continue his near-perfect play; he has won seven straight prime-time games, with 15 passing scores and just two picks in those games.",null,"Placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list for Week 12's matchup with the Ravens, Conner's status for Week 13's matchup with a stingy Washington front allowing the third-fewest fantasy points per game to backfields is undecided for now. If he's active in time for this cross-conference matchup, Conner claims some appeal as a flex candidate.","Game script proved pass-heavy for the Colts in Week 12, aiding Hilton's final line, as 55 of his 81 yards and his touchdown all came in the fourth quarter of a blowout loss to the Titans. Will Hilton see robust usage if the Colts are more competitive against Houston this week? There is enough risk present to fade Hilton, even as Houston has struggled against speedy wideouts.","Chark missed Week 12 with sore ribs and begins Week 13 as questionable. If he's able to suit up, he has a favorable Week 13 matchup as the Jaguars head to Minnesota. If he plays, be sure to get Chark back in your lineup against a Vikings defense allowing the fourth-most WR fantasy points per game.","Once a truly bankable weekly fantasy presence, Boyd's floor is clearly lowered now that Brandon Allen is behind center. With the Dolphins ceding nearly 37 fantasy points to receivers, however,  Boyd is in a good spot to bounce-back from last week's weak showing.",null,"Hurst had failed to step up in previous games where Julio Jones was sidelined, but in Week 12, he rebounded from a goose egg by catching four balls for 48 yards. Next on the docket is a visit from the tough New Orleans defense. If the Saints have a weakness, it's defending tight ends. As such, Hurst is a low-end TE1 in this NFC South affair.",null,null,null,"Brown managed only 19 yards from scrimmage and lost a fumble against the 49ers in Week 12. He's not handled more than 10 touches in any game since the team's Week 9 bye. With Cam Akers making some plays with his increased snaps over the past few games and Darrell Henderson Jr. logging plenty of playing time, this trio of backs are all impossible to trust in fantasy.","Back in action after missing more than a month with a lingering hamstring injury, Watkins reclaimed his perch as the team's second receiver. This role led to Watkins seeing seven targets for the fourth time in six appearances this season. Given the delicate nature of his soft-tissue injuries and this matchup with a solid Denver secondary, it's tough to trust Watkins in lineups.","The 49ers do not generate either sacks or takeaways as much as you'd like for a top-end fantasy D/ST unit, but they certainly have huge upside when they're in the right matchup. We saw that in Week 12 against a stumbling Rams offense, but the Bills will pose a tougher test. You can probably find a better option on waivers than the 49ers."],"14":["An illness caused Edwards-Helaire to miss his first NFL game this past Sunday evening, one that saw Le'Veon Bell struggle get any traction on the ground. The Dolphins are up next and been just a bit worse than league average in regards to yardage allowed to opposing backs, aiding the rookie's case to be a flex option or even RB2 play this week.","All Mahomes has done this year for fantasy investors is tally the fifth-most fantasy points in league history for a quarterback, per ESPN's resident fantasy historian Tristan H. Cockcroft. This past week didn't signal a huge line for Mahomes, but plenty of points were left on the field via drops and missed calls. Miami has been one of the better teams this year defending quarterbacks, but they've also yet to face Mahomes.","Carolina's Week 13 bye gave Moore's ankle some time to heal, but he was still questionable heading into Week 14. In addition, he was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list to begin the week, with his return unclear. If Moore is active for the Panthers' home date with the Broncos, consider him to be a low-end WR3 for the tough matchup.","Conner was sidelined again in Week 13 due to COVID-19. The Pitt product could rejoin the Steelers this week and reclaim his role as the top option in the backfield, setting him up as a solid flex play if active in Week 14.","It only took 11 weeks, but the old playmaking version of Hilton has shown up in consecutive weeks, as he just delivered his best game of the campaign. Philip Rivers was 8-of-10 for 110 yards and a score targeting Hilton this past Sunday, good for Hilton's most receptions and yards in a game this season. Can the wily vet keep up the momentum against an average pass defense? It's potentially worth finding out with Hilton as a flex option this week.","Poor play behind center continues to limit Chark's production; he netted just two of his seven targets this past Sunday and has topped four receptions just once since Week 7. The Titans were just beat badly by the Browns' passing game, but it's clearly a risk to trust this Jacksonville passing offense.","A sensational 72-yard touchdown in the first quarter of Week 13's tilt with the Dolphins helped Boyd register a solid fantasy performance despite that being his sole reception. The early production proved important for Boyd's fantasy managers given he was ejected later in the contest due to a scrap with a Miami defender. The Cowboys have been among the worst defenses in coverage this season, setting up Boyd as a viable flex option.",null,"After failing to catch any passes against the Saints in Week 11, Hurst managed to actually reel in one reception for nine yards in the Week 13 rematch. Week 14 is an intriguing matchup as the Falcons hit the road for a date with the Chargers and a defense allowing the eighth-fewest yards but also the second-most touchdowns per game to opposing tight ends. Hurst is in play as a low-end TE1.",null,null,"Fitzgerald has not played in two weeks, but his return to action from the reserve/COVID-19 list could be as soon as this Sunday. However, if he does return, he'll likely be eased back into action due to his lack of recent practice time. Plus, he'll also likely be splitting time with Christian Kirk and Andy Isabella. You can look elsewhere for your Week 14 starting lineup.","With Cam Akers now the focal point of the Rams' running game and Darrell Henderson Jr. providing a capable change-of-pace option in the passing game, Brown is left as just a rotational option. As such, he has very limited fantasy appeal. He will need to earn more playing time before meriting a spot in your lineups over any of the final few games of the season.","A low average depth of target combined with a fairly modest target share this past week saw Watkins produce a fairly weak fantasy line. There is always some upside in being the second receiver in a Patrick Mahomes offense, but you are knowingly assuming a good bit of risk deploying Watkins' boom-or-bust profile against the Dolphins this week.","The 49ers could not follow up on a successful outing against the Rams and struggled on Monday Night Football against the Bills. For being such a well-regarded defense, they don't generate either turnovers or sacks at a rate that's optimal for fantasy success. With a matchup against Washington on deck, they're a boom-or-bust D/ST option for those searching the waiver wire for alternatives."],"15":["Back in the mix as the team's leading playmaker from the backfield, this rookie rumbled for 91 scrimmage yards in the win over Miami in Week 14. The Saints just got gashed by the Eagles' young tailback, while Edwards-Helaire enters the matchup as a worthy flex play.","Even as he tied a career-high in interceptions this past week, Mahomes became just the third quarterback in NFL history to post at least 4,000 yards in three of his first four seasons. With at least 315 yards in six straight games, an achievement that is tied for the longest in league history, Mahomes will look to set another record this week against a capable Saints defense.","Carolina is expected to activate Moore from the reserve/COVID-19 list in advance of Saturday's Week 15 road tilt with Green Bay. Moore's absence was felt in the Panthers' Week 14 loss to Denver and he'll be needed to try and help Carolina keep pace with Aaron Rodgers and the Packers' potent offense. Green Bay's secondary is stingy but Moore still falls in low-end WR2 range.","A quad injury adds to a long list of ailments Conner has accrued this season. A sluggish Wek 14 didn't help many fantasy managers this past week, while a choice matchup with the Bengals is inviting enough to consider Conner a reasonable flex option if he's good to go.","Suddenly productive after a long scoring drought to start the season, Hilton has now entered the end zone four times in the past three games. The Colts are warming up on offense and next face a soft Houston secondary, supporting intriguing value for Hilton ahead of this division showdown.","While he's earned a strong target share and lots of air yardage this season, subpar play behind center has limited the fantasy fun for Chark and his investors. There is some potential for a bounce-back outing this week, however, as Gardner Minshew II's return signals improved passing quality.","Often considered a high-floor fantasy option given his steady pattern of production the past several seasons, Boyd's stability has taken a hit with the sizable downgrade behind center the team has endured this season. The Steelers present a real challenge for Boyd this week, thus he's a borderline flex play in most formats.",null,"Hurst's 33 snaps in Week 14 marked a season-low as he was targeted just three times, the second-fewest total on the season. He caught just one ball for seven yards. Hurst's low floor leaves him as a streaming candidate when the Falcons entertain the Buccaneers in their Week 15 encounter.",null,null,"Fitzgerald returned to action in Week 14 and handled a trio of targets, playing in a starting role for the Cardinals. He has lacked upside and scoring potential all season long, and that doesn't change upon his return to action. He's not a fantasy factor this week.","The veteran has taken a reserve role in the Rams offense as Cam Akers has ascended to the starting job. This past week, Brown and teammate Darrell Henderson Jr. combined for only 13 snaps compared to 50 for the rookie. That's a sign that Brown needs to move to the waiver wire or the bench in all leagues.","Sent just three targets in last week's victory over the Dolphins, Watkins' big-play ability isn't really so helpful when he's simply not a real factor in the team's passing plans. The Saints present a real challenge given they've allowed the seventh-fewest fantasy points to receivers this season, placing Watkins outside of flex territory.","The 49ers D/ST is extremely dependent on limiting opposition scoring in order to make an impact on your fantasy matchup as this is an incredibly average defense in terms of takeaways, sacks, and those crucial points allowed, ranking near the middle of the league in each category. If you favor a matchup with Dallas, this unit can be considered as a low-end starting option. If not, you can definitely find a better D/ST for Week 15."],"16":["A dreaded high-ankle sprain knocked this gifted rookie rusher out of Week 15's win, an injury that could cost him the remainder of the regular season. With Le'Veon Bell in place as a premium insurance policy, it's unlikely we see Edwards-Helaire on the field for this matchup with the Falcons.","Even as he completed just 55.3% of passes this past week, marking his lowest rate in a win this season and second-lowest in a game on the year. Part of the issue was a crowded pocket, as Mahomes was pressured on 46% of his dropbacks, the third most total pressures he's endured in a game in his career. The good news is that Atlanta is just 20th in pressuring passers this season, setting up Mahomes for a strong fantasy performance.","Moore's Week 15 effort likely contributed to many fantasy wins as he returned from a one-game absence and hauled in six balls for 131 yards. After eclipsing 125 yards receiving for the second time in three games, Moore has earned WR2/WR3 lineup status, despite a tough road date with Washington on the Week 16 ledger.","Injuries have mounted for Conner, and they left him off the field again this past Monday. If he's able to return to action this week, Conner would be a low-end flex play given the Colts have allowed the fourth-fewest yards per carry this season.","Another solid yardage game for Hilton unfolded this past week and he even nearly turned a long play into a score. Expectations are rightfully higher for Hilton thanks to this recent surge of production, but there is also a fairly low floor in place facing one of the league's better pass defenses.","Pacing the team in routes and receiving yards this past week, Chark still isn't in a position to help fantasy managers given a tough matchup with a Chicago defense allowing the fifth-fewest fantasy points to receivers and beset with subpar quarterback play.","A concussion suffered in Week 15 saw Boyd leave the game with just a single target and zero catches. If he's able to get back on the field this week, it helps his case as a fantasy flex that the Texans have allowed the 10th-most fantasy points to receivers on the year.",null,"Hurst emerged from a two-game slumber in Week 15, securing four balls for 21 yards and a score. It was his first time finding paydirt since Week 6. Next on the slate is a Week 16 road date with Kansas City.

DeAndre Hopkins is simply too dominant at the WR position to allow room for any other players to step up and provide decent output.","Brown could be in line for a big workload in Week 16 with Cam Akers having been ruled out. Brown ran ahead of Darrell Henderson Jr. in Week 15, meaning he might be in line for increased work -- and a viable chance at starting in fantasy this week. It's a big risk, but he's certainly a flex option in deeper leagues.","Earning the second-most air yards per target on the Chiefs this past week helped Watkins net 15 yards per catch, but it remains tough to trust a complementary receiver in the thick of the fantasy playoffs. For those in deeper leagues desperate for some upside, it's at least worth noting that the Falcons have yielded the second-most fantasy points to receivers this season","The 49ers simply don't produce enough takeaways or sacks to be a good choice for your fantasy D/ST. Arizona should avoid both of those pitfalls in Week 16, just as they did in Week 1 when these teams met. San Francisco has no place in Week 16 lineups. "],"17":["Sidelined with a high-ankle injury, we won't see Edwards-Helaire on the field until the team's first playoff game, at the earliest.","With Kansas City having clinched the AFC's top seed already, coach Andy Reid told reporters he's likely going to rest the team's key starters for Week 17. It's unclear if Mahomes will play at all this coming week against the Chargers, but it's clearly not worth putting this fantasy superstar in lineups given the obvious risk.","Moore was targeted 10 times in Week 16, but he was only able to reel in five balls for 37 yards against a tough Washington defense. Week 17 brings another tough unit as the Saints march into Carolina looking to secure the NFC's top seed and a first-round bye. The Panthers will likely have to take to the air to keep up with the potent New Orleans offense, settling Moore in WR2/WR3 territory.","Conner returned to action on Sunday and was on the field for 61% of the team's offensive snaps. The tailback was limited to 20 yards on five carries, but saved his fantasy day with a rushing touchdown and five catches for 45 yards. The Browns have been solid in limiting tailback production this year, positioning Conner as a risky flex option.","A healthy average of 20 air yards per target fittingly resulted in Hilton averaging 20 yards per catch this past week, as he surpassed Raymond Berry for third-most receiving yards in franchise history. The Jaguars have yielded the 10th-most fantasy points to receivers on the season, aiding Hilton's case as a flex candidate this Sunday.","A team-high 17.4 air yards on seven targets helped fuel a solid fantasy result for Chark in Week 16, as he tallied his first touchdown since Week 9 in the outing. The Colts' solid secondary presents enough of a challenge, however, to fade Chark in this division matchup. A leg injury late incurred late in Week 16 only adds to the fade angle for Chark.","A concussion kept Boyd out of both practice and game action this past week.

While the return of Christian McCaffery didn't help, Moore's season-long low output results from generally running downfield routes while Teddy Bridgewater leans toward shorter passes. Facing the tough Buccaneers secondary, Moore is still a must-start, just temper expectations to WR3 territory.","An absolutely ugly outing for Conner and the Pittsburgh ground game in Week 9 reads like an outlier given the longer track record of success this season. Having a short memory in fantasy can prove helpful at times, as Conner merits trust in all formats given the likelihood he nears 20 touches against a Bengals defense that has allowed 5.4 yards per carry to backs, the second-highest clip in the NFL.","A groin injury suffered in Week 8 kept Hilton out of action this past week. Maybe this was a needed reprieve all involved, as Hilton has struggled for much of the season to connect with Philip Rivers. Even if he's active and leads the Colts in routes this week against the Titans, Hilton's lack of rapport with Rivers and Tennessee's penchant for rolling coverage his way could lead to another quiet outing.","Chark helped rookie quarterback Jake Luton get acclimated with a 79-yard first quarter touchdown catch in Jacksonville's tight 27-25 defeat to Houston. For the day, Chark complied a season high 146 yards on seven grabs.

It's not even clear what that means, but in the fantasy sense, Boyd's 'high floor' is supported by consuming a steady slice of the passing offense each week.

is in running back paradise after Andy Reid and the Chiefs selected him with the 32nd pick of April's draft. The LSU product isn't particularly fast (4.60 40-yard dash) and is on the small side at 5-foot-7, 207 pounds, but he sports elite elusiveness and tackle-breaking ability. Edwards-Helaire also paced this year's rookie class in targets (65), receptions (55) and receiving yards (453) last season. He has three-down upside, though it's possible his frame could cost him goal-line touches.  Edwards-Helaire's short-term production got a big boost when potential counterpart Damien Williams opted out for the season, which positions the rookie as the clear feature back in the Chiefs' high-scoring, Patrick Mahomes-led offense. He's immediately in the RB1 mix.","Patrick Mahomes is 24 years old and has 36 NFL starts under his belt yet has already been named both league and Super Bowl MVP. So where does he go from here? Well, considering he still has Andy Reid's pass-heavy scheme, a strong offensive line and a terrific group of targets led by Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce at his disposal, we should probably expect more of the same. Granted, Mahomes returned to earth a bit last season (4,031 passing yards, 28 total TDs) after his breakout 2018 campaign (5,097 yards, 52 TDs), but he was still unquestionably one of the best players in the league. Mahomes was fantasy's No. 3 scoring QB during the 13 weeks he played in full, and that doesn't even count his 12 touchdowns in three playoff games. Mahomes remains an elite fantasy option.","The first wide receiver selected in the 2018 draft, Moore flashed with a 55-788-2 receiving line as a rookie before enjoying a full-on breakout in 2019. Moore finished as a top-10 WR in routes, targets, receptions and receiving yards. Moore's efficiency has been outstanding, as he has dropped just three of 215 career targets, while dominating with the ball in his hands (5.7 RAC). The one drawback has been a lack of scoring (six career TDs, 8.2 OTD), which has limited his ceiling. He managed only two weekly finishes better than 13th and was fantasy's No. 16 WR in 2019. Moore will have new QB Teddy Bridgewater and new coach Matt Rhule this season, but the 23-year-old's heavy usage is unlikely to change, though perhaps he'll see more goal-line work. He's a fringe WR1.","Conner returns as the lead back in Pittsburgh, but durability has become a significant concern for a player who has missed at least two games in each of his three NFL seasons. Despite missing three games in 2018, Conner broke out with 1,462 yards and 13 TDs on 269 touches en route to finishing sixth among running backs in fantasy points. He sat ninth at the position through Week 8 last season, but injuries limited him to 54 snaps the rest of the season. A return to full health by Conner and Ben Roethlisberger very well could lead to a bounce-back campaign for the 25-year-old, though he'll need to fend off Benny Snell Jr., Jaylen Samuels and rookie Anthony McFarland Jr. for touches. Consider Conner a flex option.","Hilton enters 2020 looking for a rebound following what was essentially a lost season. As if Andrew Luck's shocking August retirement wasn't enough, injuries limited Hilton to only 10 games and a situational role in the second half of the campaign. Hilton was still effective when healthy, ranking 13th in fantasy points during the six weeks he was active prior to Week 9. Hilton is now 30 years old, but has generally held up well, missing only four games during his first seven seasons. He will now have Philip Rivers throwing him passes. Hilton was a top-27 fantasy WR during each of his first seven seasons and remains very much in the WR2 discussion for 2020.","Chark entered 2019 with little fanfare, despite the fact that he was a second-round pick entering his second NFL season and positioned for a significant boost in playing time. It didn't take long for the former LSU star to get noticed. Despite Jacksonville's offensive dysfunction, Chark posted a 73-1,008-8 receiving line. His 12 end-zone targets (over 15 contests) tied for fifth most in the league and only 16 receivers scored more fantasy points. Chark is 23 years old with the size and speed to sustain top-tier production. With Gardner Minshew entering his second season and Jay Gruden perhaps adding a spark to the offense, Chark has the look of a good WR3 with upside.","Boyd seemed like a total bust through his first two seasons in the league, but the Bengals' slot man has completely shed that label with a pair of top-18 fantasy campaigns. With A.J. Green sidelined last season, Boyd finished no lower than eighth among receivers in snaps, routes run, targets and receptions. Weak quarterback play led to underwhelming efficiency numbers, but it's very possible that will improve with No. 1 overall pick Joe Burrow under center. Boyd isn't going to get you many TDs (12 TD, 7.7 OTD, 7 end zone targets over the past two seasons) and his targets will take a slight hit with the combination of Green's return and rookie Tee Higgins joining the fold. Still, the 25-year-old short-area weapon will rack up plenty of catches. Consider Boyd to be a fine WR3 in PPR formats.","Edelman enters his age-34 season fresh off a terrific 2019 campaign in which he finished as a top-five WR in routes, targets, receptions and OTD. He finished the year with a career-best seventh-place finish in fantasy points. Edelman has now finished no worse than 17th in fantasy points per game in each of his past six seasons. Despite all of the success, Edelman's stock is on the decline following Tom Brady's departure. The Patriots' offense is a strong bet for a decrease in passing volume and efficiency and, if that weren't bad enough, Edelman is now 34 and has managed only three career 16-game seasons. Edelman figures to remain prominently targeted, but is now best viewed as a WR3 with limited upside.","Hurst was traded to the Falcons following two seasons as a situational player in Baltimore. Atlanta will look to the 2018 first-round pick as a replacement for Austin Hooper. Hurst posted a modest 30-349-2 receiving line off the bench last season, but his efficiency was great. He ranked sixth at tight end in both catch rate (77%) and YPT (8.9). Hurst has yet to eclipse a 58% snap share in 30 career games, but he figures to operate as a full-time, two-way tight end in a pass-heavy Atlanta offense that helped Hooper to back-to-back TE1 campaigns. Hurst is obviously a bit risky, but the 26-year-old is well-positioned for a breakout. Consider him a mid-range TE2.","Boswell is the epitome of kickers in fantasy football, having finished 22nd or worse twice and 10th or better twice during the past four seasons. That includes a 10th-place finish in 2019 in which the Steelers' kicker managed nine top-10 weeks (fifth most). Boswell didn't miss an extra point and converted on 93.5% of 31 field goal attempts last season, which was third best in the league. Boswell has been an above-average kicker in all four of his healthy NFL seasons and, especially with Ben Roethlisberger back, the 29-year-old can be viewed as a starter in fantasy.","The 49ers were the best team in the NFC last season, but that did not lead to much fantasy relevance for Garoppolo. Appearing in more than six games in a single season for the first time in his career, Garoppolo finished 14th in fantasy points and was held to four top-10 weeks (18 QBs had more). Garoppolo tossed 27 touchdowns (fifth most) and was efficient (69% completion rate, 8.4 YPA), but he lacked opportunity in San Francisco's run-heavy offense (he finished 19th in pass attempts) and added very little with his legs (46-62-1 rushing line). Garoppolo has a good supporting cast led by George Kittle, Deebo Samuel and a great line, but the 28-year-old figures to cap out as a QB2 in Kyle Shanahan's run-heavy scheme.","Fitzgerald is back for his 17th NFL season. Arizona's primary slot receiver put together another solid season in 2019, ranking 17th in the league in receptions (75), while not dropping a single one of his 108 targets. No longer a downfield threat, Fitzgerald has ranked in the 17th percentile or lower in YPR in each of the past five seasons and hasn't cleared six touchdowns since 2015. Fitzgerald's role limited him to just one weekly finish better than 19th last season (ninth in Week 1). Fitzgerald is entering his age-37 season and his targets will take another hit with DeAndre Hopkins now in the fold. Fitzgerald has a very low ceiling and is only an option in very deep PPR leagues.","With Todd Gurley out of the picture in Los Angeles, Brown will compete with second-year Darrell Henderson and rookie Cam Akers for touches in the Rams' backfield. Brown is entering his sixth NFL season having yet to eclipse 69 carries or 11 targets in a campaign. Brown could factor in on early downs and near the goal line (he's 224 pounds and scored five touchdowns last season) but is a long shot for anything more than situational duties and is unlikely to factor in as a receiver. Consider him for your bench in deep leagues.","Watkins enters his seventh NFL season having yet to finish a season better than WR20 in fantasy points and having failed to manage a top-40 fantasy campaign since 2015. Injuries (17 missed games over the past four seasons) and a lack of touchdowns (three or fewer scores in three of the past four seasons) have been a large part of what has held him back, but Watkins also hasn't solidified himself as a consistent, go-to target. Watkins opened 2019 with a dominant 9-198-3 receiving line in Week 1, but didn't score or clear 13 fantasy points in any game the rest of the way. The 26-year-old obviously has some appeal in the Chiefs' high-scoring offense, but there's a good chance he loses work to second-year Mecole Hardman. Watkins is worth no more than a late-round flier.","After four consecutive seasons finishing 29th or worse, the 49ers' D/ST climbed all the way up to third during a breakout 2019. San Francisco ranked no lower than fifth in forced fumbles, sacks, yardage allowed, points allowed and D/ST touchdowns. Trading away arguably their best player in DeForest Buckner is a big loss for the 49ers, but the good news is that the rest of the team's 2019 core remains in place. Nick Bosa, Arik Armstead, Richard Sherman and Jimmie Ward provide the star power, with Kwon Alexander and Dee Ford likely to bring more to the table at full health this season.

Jason Garrett is gone, meaning there could be some changes to the way the Cowboys operate in the huddle, but there's no reason to believe that a back who scored 14 touchdowns a year ago would be shut out of the offense under new leadership. Start him in all leagues in Week 1 against a middling Rams rush defense.","Securing a strong second contract was a coup for Mixon in what has been a difficult market for running back talent in recent seasons. The Oklahoma product will see plenty of work for this opening matchup against a Chargers front that allowed nearly 100 yards per game on the ground to backfields last season.","Golladay took a leap toward elite status in 2019, hauling in 11 touchdowns to more than double his 2018 total. That he did so with fewer overall targets makes the feat even more impressive, as the third-year pro got more efficient and effective in the red zone. With a healthy Matthew Stafford under center, Golladay is a very appealing fantasy option. Even against a tough Bears defense (fourth-fewest WR fantasy points allowed in 2019), he's a solid WR3/flex starter for Week 1.","Much like with his quarterback, the hope is that 2019's disappointing season is an outlier and not a trend for Beckham. Held to just six catches for 64 yards in two meetings with the Ravens last season, Beckham faces a difficult for matchup to begin his second campaign with the Browns. Given an expectation for a good deal of targets in Week 1, Beckham remains a worthy WR2 option.","All Brown did as a rookie was lead the league in yards per target and tie Michael Thomas for the most top-10  fantasy finishes among receivers. Denver lost some talent in the secondary over the offseason, helping Brown's bid to open his second season with a  strong performance. ","The latest in a long line of Georgia running backs to go from Athens to the pros, Swift seems poised to be the Lions' lead back in 2020. He is productive both as a runner and receiver, although his college stats skew toward keeping the ball on the ground. He has been dealing with an undisclosed injury, and both Kerryon Johnson and Adrian Peterson will be competing for carries, so it might be wise to wait a week or two and see exactly where Swift lands on the Lions' RB depth chart before putting him in your fantasy lineup.","Montgomery is dealing with a groin injury and seems unlikely to suit up for the 2020 opener. Even if he does, soft tissue injuries always carry with them a big risk, so tread carefully and consider going with a safer option. That said, the Lions were a great matchup for opposing backs last season, so if Montgomery gets encouraging news ahead of Sunday, he's worth a spot in your Week 1 lineup.",null,"In 2019, Jones had his best fantasy season to date, averaging nearly 15 points per game and finding the end zone quite a bit. However, his scoring came in big, inconsistent chunks -- six of his nine receiving touchdowns came in just two games. He's not quite as consistent as the younger Kenny Golladay, but he's just as capable of a huge stat line. All in all, he's a risky play that's still worthy of being a  flex option against a stout Bears pass defense.","As Sam Darnold's security blanket on high-percentage, short-area targets, this slot maven's value is driven by sheer volume of opportunity. The Bills boast talented defensive backs throughout the secondary, which results in Crowder capping out as a flex option for the opener.","Leonard Fournette, accounted for 30.6% of teamâ€™s 2019 scrimmage yards, while Armstead and Chris Thompson combined forÂ just 246 rushing yards last season. Arguably the top candidate to handle early-down duties now that Fournette is with Tampa Bay, Armstead is a worthy stash to consider ahead of a meeting with a Colts defense that allowed the 10th-fewest rushing yards to backs last season.","A popular sleeper candidate coming off of a lost 2019 season due to suspension and injuries, Herndon flashed a fun rapport with Sam Darnold during the quarterback's rookie campaign. Back at practice after an injury scare last week, Herndon figures to be a busy target, albeit while facing a very difficult matchup with a stingy Buffalo defense.","Seventh among quarterbacks in fantasy points per game in a career revival last season, Tannehill is now the unquestioned signal-caller for the Titans going forward. This is an offense designed to run the ball as a priority and while the Broncos present a challenge given an established tandem of edge rushers for opposing passers, a blend of rushing potential and some exciting young pass-catchers helps Tannehill's case as a streaming option behind center.","The Buccaneers made big strides as a D/ST last season, finishing with 12-plus points in five of their final six games. That was fueled by quite a few touchdowns scored, which aren't particularly reliable, but it was also thanks to some healthy sack and turnover totals. Tampa Bay will travel to New Orleans to kick off the season and, while Drew Brees is not particularly turnover-prone, the Buccaneers could still be worthwhile as a starting D/ST.",null],"2":["Elliottâ€™s Week 1 performance reinforced why he was a top-three pick. He totaled 127 yards from scrimmage while toting the ball into the end zone twice. Week 2 presents a Falcons defense which finished last season on a roll but was shredded by Russell Wilson in Week 1, helping explain the low total of just 84 rushing yards allowed, albeit with a touchdown. Regardless, Elliott is matchup-proof. Start him.","Mixon saw 19 of the Bengals' 20 carries from the team's running backs. A rare, but ugly, fumble proved costly for both Mixon's fantasy stock and the Bengals' chances in Week 1. While a fun passing role might never surface, a featured role against Cleveland's defense supports starting fantasy value. ","Golladay did not play in Week 1 due to a hamstring injury. You'll likely need to keep an eye on his injury status all the way up until kickoff in Week 2. However, if he does suit up, he'll go up against a Green Bay defense that failed to impress in Week 1. Once healthy, he should immediately regain his status as a must-start wideout each and every week in fantasy football.","The film shows Beckham got open at a good rate in Week 1, but skittish play behind center limited him to just 22 receiving yards in Week 1, the second-lowest tally in his career. A bounce-back outing could be on the way against a more exploitable Cincinnati secondary, supporting WR2 expectations for Beckham.","It's tough to deliver WR2 results when the opportunity rates prove so conservative; Brown had just 50 total air yards sent his way. A much easier matchup awaits Brown with the Jaguars this week, thus he remains a strong starting option.","Swift led all Lions backs in playing time in Week 1, but did not lead in touches. That honor went to veteran Adrian Peterson. At this point, it appears likely that Detroit will rotate its running backs in order to try to find the hot hand, leaving them all as very risky plays in fantasy. Swift did find the end zone in his first contest but on only six touches. It's hard to trust him in Week 2 against Green Bay.","Tarik Cohen split snaps at running back with Montgomery but, as we've come to expect, it was Montgomery who saw the bulk of the touches via handoffs. Cohen's looks come more inconsistently, and primarily in the passing game. The second-year back is better in non-PPR leagues, but any player getting 15-plus touches per game is worth a shot in most fantasy leagues. He's a low-end RB2/flex option in Week 2 against a mediocre Giants defense.",null,"Even with Kenny Golladay out, Jones posted fairly pedestrian numbers in Week 1, seeing eight targets while catching only four balls. That said, he is still one of Matthew Stafford's top options and, whether Golladay plays or not, he has high upside due to his ability as a pass-catcher in the red zone. After Week 1, the Green Bay defense doesn't look to be quite as strong against the pass as it did a season ago, so lock Jones into your lineups with confidence.","The lone trusted skill player from a fantasy perspective in the offense heading into Week 2, Crowder paced the team by a wide margin in receiving opportunities this past week. Another volume-driven outing might be necessary against a solid San Francisco defense, with Crowder established as a solid flex candidate in PPR formats.",null,"A nearly 20% target share and a presence on 40 snaps this past week, with nine of them lined up out wide, Herndon's usage profile was pretty solid in the loss. The 49ers have been solid against tight ends for some time, so it could require a deep league or punting the position to stream Herndon in such a matchup.","Still somehow underrated and rostered in a small slice of ESPN leagues relative to his production pattern, Tannehill nearly produced 20 fantasy points against the Broncos in throwing his most pass attempts in a game since Week 2 of the 2016 season. ","Keeping Christian McCaffrey in check is a daunting task, but if the Tampa Bay defense can do so, Teddy Bridgewater may well be forced into mistakes. Week 2 sees the Buccaneers D/ST check in as a streaming option in deeper formats.",null],"3":["While Elliott turned in a workmanlike day on the ground, rushing for 89 yards on 22 carries, the fact that he also caught 6-of-7 targets for another 33 yards is a welcome sight. The extra attention in the Cowboys passing game could come in handy again this week against a Seahawks defense adept at stopping the run while being vulnerable against the pass. Regardless of the opponent, Elliott is a RB1 lock.","A solid day receiving salvaged a sluggish rushing effort for Mixon in Week 2. With Gio Bernard still commanding a significant share of the passing game, Mixon remains a high-end RB2 heading into a meeting with a solid Philadelphia rush defense.","Golladay looks set to make his return in Week 3, but keep an eye on the news and verify his status before locking him into your lineups. A season ago, the Cardinals offered one of the best matchups in football for opposing wideouts, but they've stepped up their game in 2020. Still, Golladay is a solid contributor with big-play potential and should be in your lineup if he's healthy.","A 43-yard score in the second frame of Week 2's win over the Bengals marked Beckham's 14th score of at least 40 yards, tied with Tyreek Hill for the second-most such scores behind just DeSean Jackson since 2014. A bit dependent on breaking a big play to deliver strong fantasy results, at least Beckham can enjoy solid matchups this week against a lackluster Washington secondary.","A bone bruise on his left knee kept Brown off the field for Week 2's win. It's unclear if Brown is able to play this week against the Vikings given his injury. If Brown is active, it's great for his fantasy profile that the Vikings are allowing the second-most fantasy points to receivers.","The Lions appear to be using a true three-man rotation at running back heading into Week 3. In Week 2, it was Kerryon Johnson who saw most of the looks in the red zone. That's a big knock against Swift, who really needs high-value touches given his limited playing time. None of these backs stand out enough to merit a fantasy start, not even against an Arizona defense that has struggled against backs so far this season (fifth-most fantasy points allowed).","Montgomery had one of the best games of his young career in Week 2, racking up 19 touches for over 120 total yards and a touchdown. The fact that he saw three targets (compared to Tarik Cohen's one) is a sign that may indicate Montgomery is developing chemistry with his quarterback and becoming a more well-rounded fantasy option. Against a porous Atlanta defense, he's a solid RB2 pick.",null,"Jones has led the Lions in snaps at wide receiver through two games with Kenny Golladay out and, while that has only turned into eight receptions and 78 yards, the opportunities are certainly there. The targets have been spread a bit thin on this offense, and Kenny Golladay seems likely to return for Week 3, but Jones still stands to play quite a bit against an Arizona team that struggled against receivers last season. Consider him as a WR3/flex pick for this matchup.","A dreaded hamstring injury could keep Crowder from suiting up this week against the Colts. Indianapolis has allowed the fewest yards to receivers this season, with Crowder positioned as a risky flex option if he's able to battle through injury this week. ",null,"It's probably not a good thing that the most noteworthy part of Herndon's performance in Week 2 was a dropped touchdown in the third quarter. Even with the Jets' receiving corps decimated by injury, Herndon didn't capitalize. The Colts, meanwhile, have allowed the fewest fantasy points to tight ends this season.  ","In a fun win over the Jaguars, Tannehill became the first Titans signal-caller since Marcus Mariota in 2016 to deliver four passing touchdowns with zero interceptions. The Vikings are allowing nearly 21 fantasy points per game to opposing passers, aiding Tannehill's case as a worthy streaming candidate.","The strong Buccaneers D/ST checks in as one of the top options this week, despite being on the road in Denver. The Broncos lost QB Drew Lock to injury, so Jeff Driskel will be at the helm. A defense can do a lot in terms of fantasy production in that scenario.",null],"4":["Elliott ran into a buzzsaw as the inspired Seattle defense held him to a paltry 34 yards on 14 carries, along with just 24 receiving yards on six grabs. Thankfully for him, a one-yard scoring plunge salvaged his Week 3 fantasy production. Elliott should benefit from the return of LT Tyron Smith and, therefore, may enjoy more running lanes against the Browns. Last week was just a blip. Elliott should return to top form in Week 4.","Producing a Frank Gore special with just 65 scoreless scrimmage yards despite 19 touches, Mixon saw backfield partner Gio Bernard thrive with 55 yards in the air this past Sunday. A ton of rushing potential this week against a porous Jacksonville front seven helps offset Mixon's weak presence as a receiving threat, setting up RB1 expectations.","Golladay made his 2020 debut in Week 3 and wasted no time reminding us what he can do. He hauled in 6-of-7 passes and scored a touchdown while playing on a majority of Detroit's snaps. As he gets healthier and more comfortable with the speed of the game following his injury absence, his fantasy potential will only grow. Consider him as a solid WR2 option against a tricky New Orleans pass defense that has allowed the sixth-fewest WR fantasy points this season.","It's fun that his average target from Baker Mayfield this past week traveled 16.7 air yards, by far the deepest of all the Browns' targets. It's not as fun to realize Beckham endured another quiet week working with Mayfield, but at least some advanced metrics suggest big plays are due against this generous Dallas secondary.","This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","Swift saw his playing time dip yet again in Week 3 as Adrian Peterson took over as the top back in the Detroit offense. Until such time as Swift regains a healthy role in the Lions offense, it's safe to leave him on the bench in fantasy.","With Tarik Cohen out for the season, Montgomery is the unquestioned top back in Chicago. He's not a passing-game specialist by any means, but he's seen three targets in each game, and should continue to combine enough rushing production with receiving upside to be an RB2/flex option in most leagues. Even against a tough Colts defense (fifth-fewest points RB fantasy allowed this season), he has enough volume to merit a start in Week 4.",null,"Even with Kenny Golladay back in action for Week 3, Jones retained his starting spot and led the Lions in WR playing time. However, Golladay had the better fantasy output and more targets which is a worrying sign for the veteran. Jones has been a bit of a boom-or-bust option for Detroit dating back to last season, and that doesn't seem likely to change now. Against a tough New Orleans defense in Week 4, consider him as a risky flex pick.","Injured these past few weeks, Crowder's return would likely mean he regains a target-rich role out of the slot. Crowder is \"flexible\" as a WR3 or flex candidate given potential for big workload if active against Denver's pass defense that rates 28th in defending receivers this season.",null,"For all of the buzz about how well Herndon and Sam Darnold connect in practice and preseason play, the results have been quiet. Maybe this choice matchup with Denver might help, as they've allowed the seventh-most fantasy points to tight ends. Herndon remains risky, but at least the matchup is inviting.","This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","Tampa Bay boasts a solid pass defense, along with a stingy run defense. The Buccaneers D/ST is a solid start against the Chargers, as most teams will be for as long as rookie Justin Herbert is under center.",null],"5":["In Week 4, Elliott failed to score for the first time this season. However, his heavy use in the Cowboys' passing game led to a productive day as he caught eight balls for 71 yards, adding to his 54 rushing yards on 12 carries. Elliott's heavy involvement in one of the most potent offenses in the league should keep his performance solid, despite facing a Giants defense that is better than the 0-4 record may suggest. Elliott is the No. 2 fantasy running back and there's no reason to think he'll give up his perch this week.","Entering Week 4 with 164 rushing yards on the season, Mixon tallied 151 in a multi-score performance that helped make up for the sluggish start to the campaign. The Ravens are allowing just 77.3 yards per game and 3.96 yards per rush to tailbacks this season, continued success in the red zone and as a receiver could help offset the matchup metrics for Mixon.",null,"Enjoying his first three-score showing since 2015, Beckham became the first Browns player with a 30-yard receiving score and a 50-yard rushing score in the same game since Leroy Kelly in 1966. A solid Colts defense is up next, but Beckham's playmaking and solid target share are enough to earn him WR2 expectations in this matchup with the Colts.","Expected to return to action after missing multiple weeks with a knee injury, Brown is poised to resume his rewarding role as a dangerous outside receiving threat for Tennessee. The Bills have some talented corners and safeties in coverage, but with Buffalo allowing nearly 40 fantasy points to receiving corps in PPR formats, Brown is in a good spot to deliver value.",null,"In Week 4, Montgomery couldn't get anything going against an Indianapolis defense that looks like one of the best in football. Still, he received 10 carries and six targets and is locked in as one of the top options on the Chicago offense. However, with the Buccaneers up next, it's hard to trust him as anything more than a flex pick given Tampa Bay's strong play against the run, both last season and at the start of 2020.","In Week 4, Samuel made his 2020 debut. Although he played on only 25 snaps, he did haul in a trio of catches. San Francisco's WR corps has been impossible to track from a fantasy perspective over the past year or so, and that remains the case with Samuel rejoining Kendrick Bourne, Brandon Aiyuk and a gaggle of others on the depth chart. Samuel is a risky flex pick for those who think he'll be back to full-time status in Week 5 against a weak Miami defense. If you're not in that group of believers, it's best to take a wait-and-see approach.",null,"In Week 4, Crowder played for the first time since the season opener and once again handled a heavy workload, catching seven passes for over 100 yards. Crowder has been a PPR superstar in the past and seems to be on pace for a similar role in 2020. Consider him as a low-end WR2 or a solid WR3 in all leagues against an Arizona defense that has recently started to show some weaknesses.",null,"Herndon has not been able to recreate the magic from Week 1, as he has hauled in only five total passes over the following three games combined. The New York tight end is not worthy of a spot in your fantasy lineup for Week 5 -- not even against the historically TE-favorable Cardinals.","Still efficient in the pocket -- he's ranked 10th in yards per attempt -- Tannehill faces a stiff challenge with a Bills defense that ranks well in both blitz and pressure rates. With Tannehill reliant on play-action success to produce big fantasy outcomes, he enters Week 5 with more risk as a borderline fantasy starter given the caliber of defensive opponent. ","Despite the quick turnaround with a Thursday night affair with the Bears on tap for Week 5, Tampa Bay is a solid play at D/ST. They're tied for third in the league with 14 sacks, to go along with surrendering the fourth-fewest total yards from scrimmage. Be it Nick Foles or Mitch Trubisky -- or even a cardboard cutout of Jim McMahon -- calling the shots for Chicago, the Buccaneers D/ST is a top-10 fantasy option for Week 5.",null],"6":["After being kept out of the end zone for the first time in Week 4, Elliott hit paydirt twice on the ground in Week 5, to go along with 91 rushing yards and another 14 through the air on his only catch. The backfield mainstay will need to step up his game even more after the loss of Dak Prescott. Look for Elliott to become more involved in the Cowboys' passing game against a Cardinals defense likely to dial up the pressure on new QB Andy Dalton.","On one hand, it's not so impressive that Mixon netted just 3.1 yards per touch in Week 5's loss to the Ravens. On the other, it's awesome that he handled nearly 65% of the team's offensive touches, as the last two weeks have signaled a sizable uptick in receiving usage for Mixon. Such a busy three-down role would help offset a challenging matchup, as the Colts are allowing just 73.2 rushing yards per game to backfields.","Golladay has scored a touchdown in both of his appearances so far this season, but his overall volume and yardage totals have left much to be desired. Jacksonville has been decent at preventing receivers from scoring fantasy points so far this season, which downgrades Golladay even further. He's still a near-WR2 given his role atop the Lions' WR depth chart, but lower your expectations if you're looking for a week-winning performance.","The Colts rolled coverage to Beckham to limit his impact and it proved effective, as he was held to a modest line in the matchup. It was nice to see Beckham tally nine targets and the outing could have been better if not for a missed communication with Baker Mayfield in the red zone. With the Steelers proving stout against the run but allowing the fourth-most fantasy points per week to receivers, Beckham could be busy in this important meeting of division foes.","Ryan Tannehill and fantasy managers are happy to have Brown back on the field, as the prolific playmaker helps open up the team's otherwise conservative passing attack. Brown is in a good spot to follow up a seven-catch Week 5 (82 yards and a score) and should deliver value facing a Houston secondary allowing roughly 37 fantasy points per game to receiving corps.","Swift handled the second-most snaps at running back for the Lions in Week 4 and hauled in a TD pass, giving him a double-digit scoring output for the third time in four games despite inconsistent playing time. Against a porous Jacksonville run defense, consider him as a risky flex pick, as both he and Adrian Peterson continue to scramble for touches and opportunities in a crowded Detroit backfield.","Montgomery has now posted back-to-back outings with 10 carries for fewer than 30 yards, but in Week 5 he made up for his lack of rushing production with a touchdown and seven receptions. The lack of a viable backup means his volume should be safe week-over-week, but watch out for the emergence of former receiver Cordarrelle Patterson. In any event, Montgomery should get the carries and catches required to be a solid RB2 this week against a porous Carolina run defense.","Samuel caught only two of the eight passes thrown his way in Week 5. With a matchup against the toughest WR defense (from a fantasy points-per-game perspective) looming, things aren't looking great despite his solid playing time. Keep Samuel on the fantasy sidelines for Week 6.","Jones had his worst outing of the season in Week 4, hauling in just a single pass for nine yards on two targets. Matthew Stafford spread his 31 passes across the entire team, with only Kenny Golladay and D'Andre Swift seeing meaningful volume. Against a solid Jacksonville pass defense (10th-fewest WR fantasy points per game allowed), keep him on the bench for Week 6.","Crowder led Jets receivers in both catches and yards while scoring the only touchdown for the club in Week 5 against Arizona. Arguably the top fantasy option on the New York offense no matter who is under center, he's a great pick for Week 6 against a Miami team that ranks \"middle of the pack\" in terms of WR fantasy points allowed this season. Lock him in as a WR3/flex in any format.",null,"Herndon finished second in yards among Jets receivers in Week 5, but that was with only 24 yards on two grabs. The TE spot has not proved to be one with a lot of upside for New York this season, and that remains true heading into Week 6. Keep him on your bench for now.","Matching last year's awesome fantasy production is unlikely for Tannehill this year, but that doesn't mean the versatile signal-caller doesn't have some streaming value in what is an inviting matchup with Houston this week. The Texans, after all, no longer collapse the pocket very often, with Houston ranked just 23rd in pressuring passers. A repeat of his supremely efficient Week 5 (21-of-28, 195 yards, 3 TD) is unlikely, but an decent fantasy day is likely to be a lock.","The Buccaneers D/ST is often a top-10 unit, but for Week 6 they slip down to the streaming tier against Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay. This unit's strength is defending the run and Rodgers has yet to be picked this season, so forcing the Packers to throw isn't as effective a ploy as it is against other offenses. Start this D/ST at your own peril.",null],"7":["Elliott had a rare \"off game\" in Monday's prime-time affair with the Cardinals, toting the ball just 12 times for 49 yards, although he was active in the passing game with 31 receiving yards. Along with amassing just 80 scrimmage yards, Elliott also lost two fumbles in the contest. He'll look to rebound in Week 7 against another tough defense as the Cowboys visit Washington. Despite the recent struggles, this veteran is matchup-proof.","An injury in the second quarter sapped Mixon of some key touches in Week 6. An ugly drop in the end zone and just 3.5 yards per touch got in the way of Mixon delivering a truly solid showing this past week. That foot injury, though, will keep Mixon sidelined for Week 7. ","Golladay went over 100 yards in Week 6 thanks in part to a 48-yard grab, and he appears to be ramping up after getting off to a delayed start this season. The Lions didn't need to throw that often against Jacksonville in Week 6, but fantasy managers can have high hopes for Week 7, when they face the Falcons. Atlanta allows the fifth-most WR fantasy points per game and this should be a high-scoring affair. As such, Golladay is a must-start in all leagues.","It wasn't a matter of playing time that saw Beckham deliver a poor Week 6, as he led the Browns in routes run. He did suffer from a lack of chances to touch the ball with just three targets, but the main story is Cleveland couldn't get good passes off under such duress from the Steelers' pass rush. Things should open up this week for Beckham and the passing game facing a lackluster Cincinnati pass rush that rates 26th in pressuring passers. ","While it would have been nice to Brown net more yardage amid a huge passing outing for Tennessee in Week 6, the contested catch maven still reeled in two scores and led the team in routes by a wide margin. With a healthy 13 air yards per target in the win over Houston, Brown proved he can convert valuable vertical balls into meaningful numbers. The Steelers are up next and while they have a great pass rush, it's worth noting Pittsburgh has allowed 39.6 fantasy points per game to receivers, ninth most in the league. ","Swift had a breakout performance in Week 6, handling a career-high 14 carries and breaking free for a 54-yard run while racking up 123 total yards from scrimmage and a pair of rushing touchdowns. The rookie from Georgia also played on more snaps than Adrian Peterson and seems to be gaining ground in the Detroit offense. Don't trust him as a superstar RB1 or anything just yet, but against a struggling Atlanta defense, he's certainly worthy of a flex spot in almost any league.","Montgomery has received 13-plus touches in every game this season. That alone is worthy of a starting spot in most fantasy leagues. Add to that his regular involvement in the Bears' passing game -- a bonus for PPR players -- and he has a little bit of upside, though not much. The Rams offer a tough test on defense in Week 7, but Montgomery is still a solid RB2/flex option in any league.","Samuel had his best outing of the season in Week 6, hauling in six passes and finding the end zone for the first time. With 14 targets over his last two games and Jimmy Garoppolo looking healthy and back to top form, Samuel is a risky-but-viable WR3/flex option in most leagues. Just know that this 49ers offense runs through the backs and tight ends, not the wide receivers. As such, don't expect a breakout performance.","Against the Jaguars, Jones finished with single-digit receiving yards for the second game in a row. The veteran does not seem to be a reliable source of fantasy production at this point despite his flashes of brilliance over the past year or so. This does seem like the perfect week for him to break out with a trio of touchdowns to frustrate fantasy managers who choose to bench him, but with only three grabs over the last two weeks, we can't recommend Jones as a fantasy starter in Week 7, even against a porous Atlanta defense.","Crowder now has seven-plus catches in all four of his appearances this season. While his 48 yards in Week 6 are certainly a disappointment compared to his 100-plus yard streak to start the season, he's still a more-than-viable fantasy option given his busy role with the Jets. Lock him in as a solid WR2 against a Buffalo defense that's middle-of-the-pack against opposing wideouts.",null,"Herndon did not have a single pass thrown his way in Week 6, despite playing on 45 total snaps against the Dolphins. Teammate and fellow TE Ryan Griffin played on half as many snaps, but did see action in the passing game. That's a concerning sign for the fantasy value of both players moving forward. Neither Jets tight end should be in your lineup against Buffalo this week.","Since Tannehill became the Titans starter in Week 7 last season, his 92.1 QBR and 12.2 yards per attempt on play-action lead all NFL QBs in that span. This week presents a very challenging matchup with a menacing Pittsburgh pass rush that might not allow Tennessee's play-action craft to develop. Tannehill merits trust in lineups given how he's been producing at a special level for a year now, but the risk against this Steelers pass rush is quite clear.","The Buccaneers defense has surrendered the fewest yards per game in the league while posting the second-highest sacks-per-game mark. The Buccaneers D/ST is a must start almost every game, including this week in Las Vegas.",null],"8":["In Week 7, Elliott posted his worst performance of the season as the Washington defense was able to key on him with the duo of Andy Dalton and Ben DiNucci both struggling under center. The star running back rushed for only 45 yards on a dozen carries, to go along with one catch for just six more yards. Elliott remains an automatic start but things won't get any easier as the Cowboys' QB situation remains unsettled and Dallas travels to Philadelphia to face the respectable Eagles defense.","A foot injury saw Mixon miss last week's fun game against the Browns. Some reports suggest Mixon might not be back until after the team's Week 9 bye, but if he's able to suit up this week, a nice matchup awaits with a Titans' defense allowing 23.6 fantasy points per game and 4.8 yards per carry to enemy backfields.","In Week 7, Golladay went over 100 yards through the air for the second straight game. While he did not score, he's proving to be a consistent source of receptions and yards in the somewhat inefficient Detroit offense. The Colts are strong on defense, but rank near the middle of the pack in terms of WR fantasy points allowed, so you can still trust Golladay as a WR3/flex pick for Week 8.","The star receiver will miss the remainder of the season with an ACL injury suffered on the team's first drive during an interception in Cleveland's Week 7 win over the Bengals. It appears Rashard Higgins is next in line for a starting role in the Browns offense.","A fantasy force since returning from injury, Brown is making his bid as a WR1 as the key red zone and play-action weapon for Ryan Tannehill. The Bengals have allowed 36.3 fantasy points per game to receiving corps, leaving room for Brown to deliver a big game.","Swift's breakout continues, as the rookie now has a touchdown in three straight games and has seen double-digit touches in both contests since the Lions' bye week. He's still splitting time in the backfield with Adrian Peterson and Kerryon Johnson, but he's the one getting the meaningful touches and is the one to trust in fantasy. He's a low-end RB2/solid flex in any format, even against a tough Colts defense in Week 8.","Montgomery remains a busy man in the Chicago offense, handling another 19 touches in Week 7's loss to the Rams. He handled 14-of-17 carries and chipped in five receptions on five targets, a healthy volume for the second-year pro. That's what we've come to expect and it's why he's a solid RB2 pick each and every week, even in a lackluster offense. The Saints are not that strong against the run, so there's no need to worry about downgrading or benching Montgomery in Week 8.","Samuel is one of many 49ers dealing with an injury, and his is particularly serious. He's likely to miss a few games, which is a huge setback for the 49ers' emerging No. 1 wideout.","Beware of Jones' sudden resurgence in the Detroit offense. Following a pair of outings with single-digit yardage, Jones did not see any meaningful uptick in targets in Week 7. (He had only six, compared to five the week before.) Sure, he caught five passes for 80 yards against a porous Atlanta secondary but the Colts are much tougher against the pass, and Kenny Golladay has proven to be a far more consistent receiver for Matthew Stafford. Therefore, we cannot recommend the veteran Jones as a starter in anything but the deepest of leagues -- and, even then, only as a flex pick.","Crowder is on the mend from a soft-tissue injury, which always carries with it plenty of uncertainty -- as we saw in the build up to Week 7. When he plays, he's a regular source of receptions with some decent upside, making him a solid WR2 pick in all leagues, even against a tough Kansas City defense. Just keep a close eye on his status and have a backup plan ready.",null,"Herndon has seen only one target over the last two games, and it's not like he's losing playing time or targets to another tight end. The TE position is simply not a priority in the Jets offense at the moment, and Herndon can be dropped or benched in all leagues and formats as a result.","The Steelers held this offense to the second-fewest total yards of offense since Tannehill took over as a starter last season, which makes it somewhat impressive he was still able to amass 17 fantasy points. The Bengals, meanwhile, are fresh from ceding five scores to Baker Mayfield. With a nice matchup, Tannehill is a solid QB1 candidate.","The Buccaneers D/ST is one of the top options on the Week 8 slate as Tampa Bay visits MetLife Stadium to take on the Giants in this week's Monday night tilt. The Buccaneers have surrendered the third-fewest average scrimmage yards per game, along with averaging the third-most sacks and generating the seventh-most turnovers per contest.",null],"9":["With the Eagles stacking the box, daring freshman signal caller Ben DiNucci to beat them, Elliott willed his way to 63 yards on 19 carries, adding 10 more on his sole reception. Not only are Elliott's yards from scrimmage down over the past three games, he hasn't seen the end zone since Week 5. Week 9 presents another challenge with the Steelers in town, but Elliott is still a lineup staple.",null,"Golladay left Detroit's Week 8 loss early with an injury and seems unlikely to return for this week's game against Minnesota. If he does, he's a must-start against one of the five best matchups for opposing wideouts in fantasy, but don't bank on his availability. Marvin Jones Jr. is next in line, with Danny Amendola and Marvin Hall potentially providing some solid numbers in Golladay's absence, as well.",null,"An impressive touchdown saved an otherwise quiet outing for Brown this past week, as he seemed to be the focus of the Cincinnati secondary. With such a strong track record as a playmaker, Brown remains a solid play this week even in a difficult matchup with the Chicago back seven.","Facing a Colts defense that is among the best in the NFL at pretty much everything, Swift managed only a single yard on the ground, although he did chip in with a trio of receptions. More importantly, however, is the playing-time breakdown, which continues to lean in Swift's favor in recent weeks. He's the clear lead back for Detroit and is the one to start this week against in a much more favorable matchup against Minnesota. He's a solid RB2/flex in all leagues.","Montgomery is one of the most consistent backs in all of football, handling a healthy number of touches for the Bears every week, but lacking in upside and rarely finding the end zone. It's hard to argue with a back who flirts with 20 touches every week, though, no matter how inefficient those touches may be. Against a struggling Tennessee defense in Week 9, he's an easy choice as an RB2 in all formats.","Samuel was not expected to return from injury this week and, now, the 49ers have added him to the reserve/COVID-19 list. As such, we won't be able to play in Week 9.","Jones wasted no time delivering solid fantasy output with Kenny Golladay injured, and we should expect more of the same in a much more favorable matchup in Week 9. Minnesota ranks near the top of the league in allowing points per game to opposing wideouts, and Jones has tons of upside as a talented red-zone pass-catcher. He's a must-start in all formats, assuming Golladay is indeed out for this fantastic Week 9 matchup.","Crowder missed his second game in a row in Week 8, and his status for the week ahead against New England is still up in the air. He's delivered solid numbers when on the field this season and would be a great WR2 option in all leagues if healthy enough to play. Just don't bank on his availability and make sure to have alternatives in mind ahead of Week 9 kickoff.",null,"Herndon lost a fumble on his only reception in Week 8 and now has scored negative points over his last three games combined. Needless to say, he should be kept out of lineups this week against New England.","With at least 17 fantasy points in all but one game this season, Tannehill has been a helpful high-floor option for those that waited on the position in drafts. This week isn't an ideal setup for fantasy fun, however, as Chicago has allowed just under 15 fantasy points per game to passers.","Tampa Bay's defense is among the best in the game, allowing the fewest scrimmage yards per game in the league, recording the second-most sacks per game and forcing the seventh-highest number of turnovers per contest. They'll be challenged this week with the Saints marching into town. Even so, the Buccaneers D/ST has performed too well to be left out of fantasy lineups.",null],"11":["Predictably, Elliott's production has waned without Dak Prescott under center but at least Dallas should come out of the Week 10 bye with Andy Dalton back at the helm. Not only did the week off help Dalton, but it also allowed Elliott to fully heal from the sore hamstring that plagued him in Week 9. Elliott projects for low-end RB1 numbers in the Cowboys' Week 11 encounter with the Vikings.","Absent from the lineup since Week 6 with a foot injury, Mixon's return would help a sputtering Cincinnati ground game wake up in time for this meeting with a Washington defense that has been respectable against opposing backfields thus far. If he can work his way back into a heavy workload, Mixon makes for a solid play this week.","In Week 10, Golladay was forced to miss his second consecutive game as a hip injury kept him out of Detroit's matchup with Washington. Golladay has yet to even practice since suffering the injury in Week 8. If he's deemed able to don the pads for the Week 11 tilt with the Panthers, look for him to put up WR2 production (with upside) as Carolina's defense has been reeling lately. However, that's by no means a guarantee to happen.",null,"In what was surely the lowest point of his campaign, Brown mustered a single catch this past week as the Colts rolled coverage his way. A return to big numbers is always possible for Brown, but first he'll need to overcome this difficult matchup with the Ravens.","Swift's first career start went well as he rushed for 81 yards on 16 carries while successfully handling all five of his targets for 68 more yards and a score. The assumption is that Swift will remain the Lions' lead back, with Adrian Peterson stepping into more of a secondary role. More will be known after the Lions' Week 11 matchup with a vulnerable Panthers defense, but Swift's Week 10 success points to RB1 production.",null,null,"In Week 10, Jones secured a scoring strike for the third straight game, reeling in eight total balls for 96 yards against Washington, the league's stingiest secondary. Jones has a chance for another big day -- perhaps as the Lions' No. 1 receiver -- with Kenny Golladay still questionable to return for Detroit's Week 11 trip to Carolina. In Week 10, the Panthers' pass defense was shredded for 341 yards and three scores by Tom Brady, landing Jones as a flex play.","A proven rapport with Sam Darnold as a heavy target out of the slot aids Crowder's fantasy appeal heading into this tougher matchup with the Chargers. It helps his case as a flex option or even a WR3 that Crowder can build a strong outing via volume to counter the fact the Chargers have allowed the sixth-fewest fantasy points per game to receivers. ",null,"The breakout hype has come to a halt with Herndon barely registering as an option for this offense of late.

They are definitely worth starting in the final game of Week 11's slate.",null],"12":["Aided by the Week 11 return of Andy Dalton and refreshed after the bye week, Elliott surpassed 100 yards on the ground for the first time this season.

Just temper your expectations against one of the toughest run defenses in the league.",null,"The Lions have clearly missed Golladay in the passing game over the past few weeks, and his return on Thanksgiving would be welcome news both to those in Detroit as well as those who roster the wideout in fantasy. Houston is one of the weaker defenses in the NFL and would provide a great matchup for Golladay in his return, so keep an eye on the injury report.",null,"A devastating playmaker in the open field, Brown broke multiple tackles on his clutch scoring play in Week 11. Pacing the NFL in yards after contact per reception, Brown is still a worthy fantasy starter even against a Colts secondary that shut him down a few weeks back.","Swift is uncertain to play in Week 12, as the Lions play on Thursday and he's slowly recovering from a head injury. If he does get clearance to play, he should find himself again leading the Lions' RB depth chart in a game against a team with a porous run defense. However, at this point, his ability to play seems unlikely. Expect a mix of Kerryon Johnson and Adrian Peterson in the backfield for Detroit on Thanksgiving.","Montgomery is on the mend from a concussion but has been spotted in practice following the bye week -- an encouraging step forward in his recovery. If he's eligible to play and slated to start in Week 12, he'd be one of the most reliable high-volume backs in the NFL and worth a spot as an RB2/flex in most leagues. This is especially the case against a Green Bay defense that's one of only three units allowing 30-plus RB fantasy points per game.","Samuel is one of several San Francisco skill-position players aiming to return from injury in Week 12. He (along with Raheem Mostert) would be in consideration for your fantasy lineup if he's healthy. He earned a very viable share of the 49ers offense when in the lineup earlier this season and could deliver a handful of receptions against the Rams this week. However, Los Angeles is a very tough matchup, so perhaps you should consider using a healthy Samuel only as a last resort.","If Kenny Golladay remains out on Thanksgiving, Jones will lead the WR position again for the Lions against a Houston defense that provides an above-average matchup for opposing wideouts. That's good enough for a flex spot in most fantasy leagues, even with Detroit showcasing their ability to struggle when attempting to move the ball in Week 11 against the Panthers.","On one hand, it's interesting that Crowder just earned his first full batch of snaps and routes since Week 6 due to lingering injuries. On the other, it's telling that this slot maven was held to just one catch on three targets in the loss to the Chargers. Likely the best fantasy option from the Jets this week, Crowder is a risky play even amid a nice matchup with Miami.",null,"Even as Herndon just scored his first touchdown since 2018, there's not much to like about his prospects in this division matchup with Miami. ","Given his long and winding path back to a starting NFL gig, it's somewhat amazing that Tannehill has tallied an NFL-best 17 games with multiple passing scores since becoming the Titans' start in Week 7 last season. Less amazing is this matchup with the Colts, arguably the best pass defense in football and one that stifled Tannehill just two weeks back. With such legitimate matchup concerns, you might want to find a stronger streaming option.","The solid Buccaneers defense will be put to the test in Week 12's home encounter with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. Not only does Mahomes light up the scoreboard, but he's only been sacked only a dozen times while throwing just a pair of picks. Look for a better option than this one.",null],"13":["Gameflow and ineffectiveness led to Elliott's fewest handles of the season on Thanksgiving. He ran only 10 times for 32 yards, adding just one catch for seven yards. Elliott also fumbled for the sixth time this season, five of those miscues resulting in turnovers. Elliott should still be active in all but the shallowest of leagues. Just don't expect more than low-end RB2 numbers in the Cowboys' Week 13 visit to Baltimore.",null,"Will we finally see Golladay return to action in Week 13? It's possible and, if he does, he should go straight back into fantasy lineups. Not even a matchup with the imposing Chicago defense should stop you from starting the Detroit pass-catcher, who went over 100 yards in both of his last two healthy starts. Golladay will help to right an inconsistent Lions offense.",null,"Even with the Titans turning the offense over Derrick Henry for much of Week 12, Brown's unique big-play ability still surfaced in the win over the Colts. The second-year standout now has 16 receiving scores in his first 25 career games, while only Odell Beckham Jr. (24), Randy Moss (23), Rob Gronkowski (18), & A.J. Green (17) posted more through their first 25 career games since 1990. The Browns have yielded nearly 40 fantasy points per game to receivers, setting up Brown for another strong showing.","Swift's return to the practice field is a positive sign as he looks to return to action post-concussion. Keep a close eye on the injury reports just to make sure. If he is back, he'd be a solid starting option after clearly claiming the top spot among rushers for the Lions prior to his injury. He had racked up 15-plus touches and at least 90 yards from scrimmage in both of his last two games before his injury absence. Lock him in as an RB2 in all leagues.","Welcome back, David Montgomery! Even in a lopsided Week 12 loss for the Bears, the second-year pro racked up 143 total yards and scored a touchdown on six targets. The only reason to be skeptical was that it came in a matchup with a weak run defense from Green Bay, but Week 13 brings a matchup with the rare team that allows more RB fantasy points per game than the Packers. Lock in Montgomery as a must-start against the Lions this week.","One of several 49ers returning to action in Week 12, Samuel had the biggest game of them all, posting season-highs in catches, yards and targets while leading a receiving corps missing impact rookie Brandon Aiyuk. Samuel's chemistry with Nick Mullens appears to be strong, so consider him as a solid WR3 (or a very reliable flex option) this week against a decent (but not overwhelming) Buffalo defense.","Jones had the ball thrown his way 12 times in Week 12, yet those targets turned into only 48 yards on six catches. That's a common stat line for Jones, who relies heavily on touchdowns to drive his fantasy value. The Lions turned to Adrian Peterson in red-zone situations against Houston, shutting out the veteran receiver. A matchup with a tough Chicago defense looms, and Kenny Golladay could return from injury for Week 13 -- both signs that Jones should move to the bench in most fantasy formats.","Crowder handled 3-of-5 targets for 31 yards in Week 12. After compiling double-digit targets in his first four games played, Crowder has logged no more than five in any of his last three contests. The declining involvement in the Jets aerial onslaught precludes Crowder from fantasy consideration in Week 13's home date with the Raiders.",null,"Herndon's streak of catching a TD pass ended at -- one in a row. In fact, he was completely shut out of the Week 12 boxscore, despite seeing his most snaps since Week 4. Herndon remains a fantasy non-entity.","Bouncing back nicely from a recent sluggish statistical stretch, Tannehill has now posted at least 19 fantasy points in consecutive games and just delivered his fifth game with Tennessee with one passing and one rushing score, tied for the fourth-most such games in franchise history. The Browns claim some talented edge rushers, but have surrendered the 12th-most fantasy points per game to enemy passers, suggesting Tannehill is once again in the streaming tier at the position.",null,null],"14":["While it was far from vintage Elliott, the Cowboys running back rebounded from a subpar effort, rushing for 77 yards on 18 carries (along with hauling in four passes for 18 yards) as Dallas was defeated by the Ravens in Week 13. Elliott's production has fallen from RB1 level, but he's still an automatic start when the Cowboys visit the Bengals in Week 14.",null,"In Week 13, Golladay was sidelined yet again with a lingering hip injury, but his return to the Detroit huddle seems closer and closer with every new report. If he is cleared to play in Week 14 against Green Bay, he'd re-assume his status as a must-start receiver in all leagues. Just keep a close eye on his health.",null,"A fumble near the goal line and a drop on a catchable ball saw Brown leave some fantasy production on the field against Cleveland this past week. Then again, he still averaged an awesome 21.75 yards per catch and almost scored. Next up is a choice matchup with a depleted Jacksonville secondary, setting up Brown as a strong starting fantasy option.","Swift hasn't played in three weeks, and obviously we'll need to wait to see if he's cleared to play against Green Bay in Week 14. If he is, he'll be matched up against one of the worst run defenses in football and should be in all lineups. However, keep a very close eye on the news, as he's been dealing with both a concussion and an illness so we can't be completely sure when he'll be back in action.","When healthy, Montgomery is one of the most reliable backs in fantasy. He has handled double-digit carries in every start this season -- with a handful of targets in most outings, as well. His main issue for most of the first nine weeks of the 2020 season was scoring touchdowns, but over his last two games, he's scored three times. This is a very encouraging trend heading into a matchup with a Houston defense that is among the worst at stopping opposing running backs. He's one of the top RB options in fantasy this week.","In a game which required plenty of passing from the 49ers, Samuel joined rookie Brandon Aiyuk atop the charts for most stats on Monday against the Bills. However, it was Aiyuk who found the end zone and had the better fantasy output. Samuel has big-play potential and is a trusted target for Nick Mullens, but the passing game for the 49ers is inefficient and lacks upside. That means Samuel, in a tough matchup with Washington, is just a flex option for Week 14.","Jones delivered his best performance of the season in Week 13, but he's been inconsistent in his performances since Kenny Golladay was sidelined a few weeks ago. We're talking about two games without touchdowns and under 60 yards in his last three efforts. Against a tough Green Bay defense, Jones would be a solid starter if Golladay is out once again, but he falls to flex flier territory should his teammate be cleared to play.","An awesome first half against the Raiders for this slot maven included two touchdowns, but he didn't much damage from scrimmage in the loss. Given his success in the red zone of late, maybe a matchup with one of the league's worst pass defenses can help Crowder deliver flex value this weekend.",null,"Sixteen routes and zero targets doesn't happen very often, but Herndon pulled it off this past week. Essentially a non-factor at this stage in the offense, even a nice matchup with a leaky back seven isn't enough to create fantasy value for Herndon.","In a game that saw Tannehill deliver a season-high in yardage, it's somewhat wild to note he converted just one third down through the air this past Sunday and it didn't happen until deep into the final quarter in a loss to Cleveland. Even while missing some key weapons, Tannehill continued to post strong fantasy numbers this past week. A nice setup against the Jaguars positions Tannehill as a strong play this week.","The Buccaneers D/ST is one of the league's finest, ranking in the upper echelon in fewest yards from scrimmage, sacks, and turnovers created per game. With a chance to use the bye week to help scheme for the Vikings in a Week 14 home date, Tampa Bay is one of the top plays on the board.",null],"15":["In Week 14, Elliott split carries with Tony Pollard in a blowout win over the Bengals that should have led to him getting a bigger workload as the Cowboys ran to protect the lead. However, Elliott was slowed by a calf injury during the week so perhaps the Cowboys limited him to just 12 carries (48 yards) to protect his health, given the score. The chance he's still playing hurt, along with the fact he'll be facing the 49ers and the league's fourth-best run defense, drops Elliott into the RB2 tier for Week 15.",null,"Golladay's return from a hip injury has been slow and steady, and a rumored-to-be \"limited role\" in Week 14 did not materialize. At this point, given his extended absence, it's not even safe to assume he'll play a full game if (when) he does return, or that he'll perhaps be able to play at full capacity in short spurts. If you've found a capable replacement over the past two months for the injured receiver, it's safest to keep that other guy plugged into your lineup and not risk it with Golladay, even if he is cleared to play.",null,"Now fifth in the NFL with 17 receiving scores since the start of last season, Brown is a weekly threat to take one to the house and brings a fairly high yardage floor to the field each week. With the Lions' secondary banged up, Brown is in a great spot this week.","In Week 14, Swift was back atop the Lions' RB depth chart after being cleared to play following a three-week absence and he found the end zone to salvage an otherwise disappointing performance against Green Bay. The Packers don't have a very good run defense, so for Swift to only manage 24 yards is somewhat disappointing. However, he's clearly Detroit's lead back and faces a similarly weak run defense in Week 15. He's a solid option against the Titans.","Since his return from injury (and the Bears' bye week), Montgomery has been one of the best players in all of fantasy, racking up nearly 400 yards from scrimmage with four touchdowns over the last three games. Sure, those strong showings have been in matchups with three of the worst run defenses in the NFL, but the Vikings aren't much better. Ronald Jones posted respectable numbers against Minnesota last week, and Montgomery will as well in Week 15. He's a solid starter in all formats.","Samuel has a hamstring injury that will keep him out of action for the rest of the season. Brandon Aiyuk and Kendrick Bourne will lead the way at receiver for the 49ers from this point forward,","Jones struggled against the formidable pass defense of the Packers, racking up only 48 yards on four receptions. However, he did handle eight targets, continuing the increased volume trend for the veteran with Kenny Golladay out. The Titans have one of the worst pass defenses in football, but Jones' fantasy value will depend on who starts at quarterback for Detroit. If Matthew Stafford is cleared to play, Jones is a solid WR2 in all formats. If it's Chase Daniel, Jones' upside is limited to that of a flex play, though he would still be lineup-worthy in most leagues.","A calf injury saw Crowder produce just two of his five targets in an ugly outing for the Jets' offense this past week. The Rams present a major challenge for the New York offense, enough so that Crowder isn't even a viable fantasy starter.",null,"This Jets offense simply doesn't lean on its tight ends to move the chains, evidenced by Herndon barely even registering as a target in recent weeks. This is an easy fade for Week 15 given how good the Rams' pass defense proves.","Tannehill was once again elite on play-action attempts this past week, including four-of-four and a TD targeting A.J. Brown on such throws. That is Tannehill's best play-action completion percentage this season. The Lions, meanwhile, are one of just seven teams allowing at least 20 fantasy points per game to quarterbacks.","The Buccaneers defense kept Kirk Cousins under wraps in Week 14, but Dalvin Cook did run over them for 102 yards. Week 15 brings a visit to Atlanta and a struggling Matt Ryan. It should be another productive game for the Tampa Bay D/ST, which checks in as one of the best options on the docket.",null],"16":["A sore calf prevented Elliott from donning the pads in Week 15, but the Cowboys are hopeful he'll be able to suit up for Week 16's visit from Philadelphia. The Eagles defense has yielded the 10th-fewest RB fantasy points per game. If he plays, Elliott will likely cede more carries to Tony Pollard than usual. As such, while Elliott should still be started in most instances, it's best to expect RB2-level production.","It's possible the Bengals bring Mixon back into the backfield mix for the final two weeks of the season, but there is also inherent risk in deploying a key playmaker while eliminated from playoff contention. If he does return, there isn't a better matchup for the gifted back than Houston, as the Texans have allowed the most yards per carry to backs this season.","At this point, it's looking more and more like Golladay is simply done for the season. He's not making any meaningful progress towards a return and any news of a comeback should be viewed with some skepticism. Be prepared with multiple backup plans if you still roster Golladay.",null,"With another score this past week, Brown now has 10 touchdowns on the season and joins only Drew Bennett from 2004 as the two players to have produced double-digit receiving scores in a season since the team moved to Tennessee. The Packers have been solid against the pass, but that shouldn't slow Brown from producing another big line.","Swift was back to full strength in Week 15, handling 19 touches and scoring twice as the lead back for the Lions. When healthy, he is the leader and focal point of the Detroit offense. However, he will face a tough test against a stalwart Tampa Bay run defense in Week 16. His volume and red-zone opportunities mean he's a viable starter, but he's more of an RB2 given the matchup.","Montgomery handled a season-high 32 carries against Minnesota in Week 15 and will hope to keep up that momentum against one of the three best matchups for opposing backs in fantasy. The Jaguars have been  struggling on defense of late, so Montgomery could have another huge game. He's easily an RB1 for this pivotal week of the fantasy season.",null,"In Week 15, Jones finished with 12 targets for the third time in four games. He also hauled in over 100 yards for the second time in three contests. This Detroit offense isn't perfect, and there will be weeks when Jones and Matthew Stafford don't click, but the volume and upside are sufficient to merit a start in your fantasy lineup.","The Jets' slot maven netted six catches on eight targets this past week, but the volume wasn't high enough to really deliver a strong fantasy result. If there is any skill player to trust in lineups from the Jets against the Browns' soft pass defense it would be Crowder, although it's clearly still a gamble.",null,"The hype for a breakout season for Herndon hasn't resulted in actual production, as he's rarely targeted and splits snaps with a veteran peer. The Browns are a nice matchup, but Herndon just won't see the ball enough.","Up to 31 passing scores for the season, Tannehill is just the third player in Titans/Oilers franchise history to throw at least 30 touchdowns in a season, joining Hall of Famers George Blanda and Warren Moon. The Packers have been solid against quarterbacks this season, but Tannehill's unique play-action success supports another big line.","In Week 15, Tampa Bay allowed Matt Ryan to post his best numbers since Week 1 as he threw for 356 yards and three scores. However, the Buccaneers defense clamped down in the second half, paving the way for a 31-27 comeback win. Next up is a Saturday road trip to Detroit, where the Buccaneers D/ST will be challenged. Still, this remain one of the best units in the NFL and should definitely be in consideration for a fantasy start. ",null],"17":["After missing Week 15 with a calf injury, Elliott looked to be rejuvenated in Week 16, rushing for 105 yards on 19 carries while adding four grabs for another 34 yards. Dallas can win the NFC East win a win over the Giants and a Washington loss. With Washington playing the Sunday night game, expect an all-out effort, with Elliott in a favorable matchup against a Giants defense rendering the ninth-most RB fantasy points per game.",null,"Even if Golladay returns for Week 17, there's no guarantee he'll be playing at 100% or even playing with his usual starting quarterback. There is far too much risk here for such a pivotal week in many fantasy leagues.",null,"Sent eight targets but held to just 43 scoreless yards in Week 16, Brown is looking to get back into the end zone this week against a porous Houston secondary that has struggled in coverage.","Not much can be taken from Detroit's Week 16 blowout loss, but Swift did lead the backfield while the Lions were still running their first-team offense. Against a weak Minnesota run defense, he's a viable option in Week 17, but with nothing to play for, there's always the risk his playing time is limited.","Montgomery continued his solid season with another game of 100-plus yards from scrimmage and a touchdown, his fifth such outing in a row. The Packers are much weaker against running backs than they are against passing games, making this a great time to keep Montgomery locked into your lineup for Week 17.",null,"It's hard to draw conclusions based on the Lions' play in Week 16, and Jones is no exception. Kenny Golladay will likely remain out in Week 17, so if you trust Jones to play all game with nothing on the line for the Lions, then he's a fine WR3/flex pick against a weak Minnesota secondary.","Making his bid as the best passer on the roster, Crowder tossed his first career touchdown last week and also secured a receiving score in the win, becoming the third player in Jets franchise history with a passing and receiving score in the same game. The Patriots have been solid against the pass for the most part, but Crowder is the rare skill player for the Jets worth trusting this week.",null,"A breakout never developed for Herndon this season, as the tight end struggled to build a rapport with Sam Darnold and the position simply hasn't been a feature of this offense the past two years. It's best to look elsewhere for tight end talent in fantasy lineups this week.","Producing one rushing score and one passing touchdown in an otherwise ugly outing with just 121 passing yards this past Sunday reveals just how solid Tannehill's fantasy profile proves; even in a bad game he was still able to secure helpful statistics. The Texans, meanwhile, present one of the most favorable matchups in the league this week.","The Buccaneers have an outside chance to lead the NFL in sacks if they can get to Matt Ryan enough times in Week 17. Tampa Bay is also near the top of the table in terms of turnovers generated. Since the team's starters will be playing (with a better playoff seed still on the line), the Buccaneers D/ST is a solid fantasy start.",null],"10":[null,"Off the field for several weeks with a foot injury, Mixon could return this week in time for a difficult matchup with the Steelers. For some matchup context, Pittsburgh has allowed the fewest fantasy points per game to backfields by a notable margin. A tough matchup as he eases back from injury reveals some risk for Mixon this week, but a heavy workload would help offset such concerns.","Golladay did not return to the practice field ahead of Week 9, and his status for Week 10 is certainly in doubt. Should he return, he's one of the top wideouts in fantasy and belongs in your starting lineup, but keep an eye on his injury status.",null,"Posting a score in five straight games, the longest streak by a Titans receiver since Kenny Britt back in 2010, Brown has become one the best fantasy options at his position in just his second season. The Colts present a real challenge for wideouts, with Indianapolis allowing the 11th-fewest fantasy points per game to the position, but Brown's uniquely valuable contested catch skills can overcome most matchups.","The Lions appear dedicated to rotating all three of their running backs into the game each week, with Swift, Adrian Peterson and Kerryon Johnson all playing on more than 20 snaps in Week 9. Swift led the way, however, and handled a team-high 16 touches, so he's the top back for fantasy purposes moving forward. Against a solid Washington defense, he's a decent RB2 option in most leagues in Week 10.","Montgomery has entered the NFL's concussion protocol and his status for Week 10 is in doubt. Chicago relies heavily on the second-year pro and he'd be a solid fantasy option if he's cleared to play, especially in a prime matchup with a lackluster Minnesota defense. Just keep an eye on the injury reports this week.","Samuel has been dealing with injuries all season, as well as a stint on the reserve/COVID-19 list, but he could be active and starting this week against the Saints. If so, he'd need to prove that he's back to 100% and atop the depth chart at his position before meriting a start in any fantasy leagues, but stash him on your bench if he's available on waivers, as he could prove to be a decent depth option down the stretch.","Jones was fairly quiet in Week 9 despite Kenny Golladay's absence, handling only four targets, catching three. He did score a touchdown to salvage his fantasy output, but he's been very end-zone dependent this season. If Golladay returns, Jones should be moved to the bench in all but the deepest of leagues, but as the team's top receiver with Golladay out, he merits a start as a WR3 or flex if the latter is sidelined.",null,null,null,"With multiple scores in all but one start this season, Tannehill even produced a respectable enough showing against the stingy Bears. The Titans thrive on play-action schemes and Tannehill's scoring chemistry with A.J. Brown is proving uniquely dangerous. This said, it's wise to project a modest line for Tannehill again this week given the Colts have been so stingy against opposing passers.","Still reeling after the Saints marched all over them in Week 9, the usually solid Buccaneers D/ST looks to rebound against Teddy Bridgewater and the Carolina Panthers.

returns as the clear feature back in Dallas. Since entering the league in 2016, the Ohio State product leads the NFL in carries (1,169) and rushing yards (5,405), and sits second in rushing touchdowns (40). Elliott obviously plays a substantial role as a ball carrier -- and his goal-line work increased last season -- but it was a bit surprising to see his targets fall from 6.3 to 4.4 per game last season. Of course, Elliott's role still allowed him a top-3 finish in touches, yards and fantasy points. The 25-year-old is positioned for a similar role in 2020 behind a strong offensive line and should be off the board in the middle of the first round of drafts.","Mixon enters his fourth NFL season as the clear feature back in Cincinnati. The role has allowed Mixon a top-seven finish in touches, top-11 finish in yards and eight-plus touchdowns each of the past two seasons. Despite the heavy usage, a limited role as a pass-catcher has left Mixon with fantasy finishes of 10th and 13th during that span. Mixon is one of the game's better talents at the position, but the Cincinnati offensive line remains a work in progress and his target share is unlikely to see a significant boost with A.J. Green back, Tee Higgins drafted and Giovani Bernard still in the fold. Consider Mixon a borderline top-10 RB.","After flashing in 11 games as a third-round rookie in 2017, Golladay has emerged as one of the game's top wide receivers over the past two seasons. Golladay has never finished as a top-15 WR in targets, but has put up a pair of 1,000-yard seasons and paced the NFL with 11 touchdown receptions in 2019. A force deep downfield and near the end zone, Golladay finished in the top 10 in YPT, YPR, aDOT and end-zone targets in 2019. Fantasy's reigning No. 9 WR has emerged as Detroit's top offensive weapon. Considering Matthew Stafford missed half of last season, we may have yet to see the 26-year-old's best work. Golladay is a fringe WR1.","Beckham returns for his second season with the Browns following an underwhelming 2019 campaign in which he posted a 74-1,035-4 receiving line and was held to just a single top-10 fantasy week. That stat line would be respectable output for most players, but it's not quite enough for a player who averaged a 96-1,374-12 line during his first three seasons in the league (2014-16). The good news is that Beckham is still in his prime at age 27. He should see some touchdown regression to the mean (4 TD, 5.8 OTD) and the Cleveland offense should be more efficient under new coach Kevin Stefanski. Beckham is best viewed as a mid-to-back-end WR2, but there's obvious upside here.","Brown is entering his second NFL season after quite the roller-coaster rookie campaign. Following a boom/bust first couple of months, the second-round pick peaked after the Titans' Week 11 bye, posting the second-most fantasy points and four top-10 weeks from that point forward. His five top-10 outings for the season trailed only Michael Thomas for the league high. Brown then crashed back to earth in the playoffs with a mere 64 yards in three games. The inconsistency was frustrating, but Brown appears to be the real deal. His 12.5 YPT and 9.0 RAC both topped the position and he dropped only one of his 84 targets. Brown's TD rate will regress (8 TD, 3.7 OTD), but a boost in volume is probable in Year 2. Consider Ryan Tannehill's top weapon to be a fringe WR2 with upside.","The Lions selected Swift with the 35th pick of April's draft. Swift was terrific in Georgia's pro-style offense, producing as both a rusher (440 carries) and receiver (73 receptions) during his three seasons. His efficiency was more solid than spectacular, and he lacks some explosiveness, but he makes up for it with reliability, decent speed (4.48 40-yard dash), quickness and pass-catching prowess. Swift has three-down upside but will begin his career competing for reps with Kerryon Johnson, who figures to focus primarily on ball-carrying, with Swift busier in passing situations. That's likely to limit Swift's fantasy output, but he certainly could flirt with RB2 numbers and is worth a midround pick.","Montgomery's rookie season didn't go as planned, but the 2019 third-round pick remains atop the Chicago depth chart. The Iowa State product wasn't short on volume in his first season, ranking 12th among backs in touches and sixth in carries inside the 5 (14). The problem was a combination of poor rushing efficiency (3.7 YPC, 1.6 YAC) and a lack of volume and effectiveness as a pass-catcher (185 yards on 37 targets). The end result was two top-15 fantasy weeks and a 24th-place finish by season's end. Montgomery will continue to defer passing-down work to Tarik Cohen but is certainly a breakout candidate in his second season. Montgomery is a flex option with RB2 upside.","It took Samuel a couple of months to get rolling, but the 2019 second-round pick worked his way to a prominent offensive role right around the midpoint of his rookie season. From Weeks 10-17, the South Carolina product played on 82% of the 49ers' snaps. Powered by 697 yards and four touchdowns, he was fantasy's No. 9 scoring WR. He kept it up in the playoffs with 229 yards on 16 touches. Samuel was primarily used near the line of scrimmage, posting one of the position's lowest aDOTs (7.7), but also the fifth-best catch rate (71%), the seventh-best YPT (10.0) and the second-best RAC (8.1). A weapon as both a receiver and rusher, Samuel shouldn't struggle for touches in Kyle Shanahan's offense once he returns from a foot injury. He's a solid WR3 option with upside once healthy, so take him with a late-round pick.","Jones, Kenny Golladay and Danny Amendola played 12 games together last season. The target breakdown in those weeks were as follows: Jones had 86 (20% share), Golladay had 85 (20%), and Amendola saw 78 (18%). When Jones was out during Weeks 15-17, Golladay only edged Amendola 23-20 (24%-21%) in that category. This trio is probably closer than you realize in usage, which may lead to Jones being undervalued in fantasy again. He's now 30, but Jones has scored nine touchdowns in two of the past three seasons and was on pace for nine in 2018 prior to an injury. He finished 14th, 27th and 20th in fantasy points per game during that span.","Crowder has emerged as one of the game's top slot/short-area targets and that skill was on full display in his first season with the Jets. The longtime slot man in Washington posted a healthy 78-833-6 receiving line in New York, leading to a 26th-place finish in fantasy points. Crowder finished near the basement of the position in aDOT (8.1) for the fifth time in as many seasons, which limited big plays (6.8 YPT), but allowed him to soak up receptions (16th most). At 5-foot-8, 185 pounds, Crowder won't get you many touchdowns. Heck, he has only 20 career end zone targets. Still, Sam Darnold's top option will catch enough passes to allow for flex production in PPR leagues.","Armstead enters his second professional season competing for lead back duties following the August release of Leonard Fournette. The 2019 fifth-round pick produced 108 yards on 35 carries (3.1 YPC, 1.9 YAC) and 144 yards and a pair of touchdowns on 24 targets (6.0 YPT) off the bench as a rookie. Armstead will certainly defer passing-down work to Chris Thompson, but could emerge as a flex if he fends off Devin Ozigbo (among others) for primary ball-carrier duties. He's a fine mid-round flier.","Herndon is back on the fantasy radar following an injury-plagued 2019 campaign in which he was limited to 16 snaps. The Jets selected Herndon in the fourth round of the 2018 draft and quickly put him in position for a big role. The Miami product was on the field for 63% of New York's snaps and, following a slow start, was fantasy's No. 9 tight end from Week 6 on. His 10.3 aDOT was fifth-highest at the position and helped him to a strong 9.0 YPT (10th). Herndon's 502 receiving yards rank 12th, his catch rate 12th, his YPT fourth and his aDOT second among rookie tight ends since 2007. Herndon is an excellent post-hype target and positioned well for a breakout.","Tannehill signed a four-year extension with Tennessee following an impressive bounce-back 2019 campaign in which he completed 70% of his passes (third best) and posted 9.6 YPA (first). Tennessee scored three-plus touchdowns in 12 of Tannehill's 13 starts, which helped the 31-year-old to the third-most fantasy points among quarterbacks from Week 7 on. Tannehill has been around since 2012, but he has finished only one season as a top-15 fantasy QB and is a strong bet for statistical regression to the mean. With the Titans' extremely run-heavy offense also in mind, the veteran passer is best viewed as a solid QB2.","All eyes are on Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay offense this offseason, but don't overlook a defense that is trending in the right direction. The upward trajectory began last season, with Tampa Bay scoring 15 more fantasy points than the next-closest D/ST from Week 12 on. In total, the Buccaneers ended up third in forced fumbles, seventh in sacks, first in passes defensed and second in D/ST touchdowns. Tampa Bay re-signed Ndamukong Suh, Shaquil Barrett and Jason Pierre-Paul during the offseason, which means 11 of team's top 12 snap-getters on defense are on the 2020 roster. The defense is also loaded with recent early-round picks who could make a leap, including Antoine Winfield Jr., Devin White, Vita Vea, Carlton Davis, Sean Murphy-Bunting, Jamel Dean and Mike Edwards.

put it all together last season, totaling over 1,600 yards from scrimmage and scoring 13 times in his third NFL campaign. The focal point of the Minnesota offense through the first half of the year, injuries and a shift in offensive philosophy limited his impact down the stretch. Rested and ready for the season, there's no reason to doubt Cook in Week 1 against the Packers. He should be a lock for all lineups.","Jones doubled his touchdown total from 2018 to 2019 and was fantasy's second-best back as a result. The fourth-year pro out of UTEP received tons of work in the red zone and figures to be the focal point of the Green Bay offense inside the 20 again in 2020. He had a pair of big games against the Vikings in 2019, so expect more of the same to begin the new season. He's a solid RB2, or perhaps even a low-end RB1, for the kickoff of the new season.","A seemingly lost season in 2019 saw Smith-Schuster struggle with both injuries and poor quarterback play, setting him up as a fun bounce-back target given the return of Ben Roethlisberger to the offense. There might not be a better opening matchup for the USC than the Giants, as New York allowed the third-most yards to receivers last year.","Lockett has taken two big steps forward in recent seasons, first in terms of big plays in 2018, then in terms of volume in 2019. Should he take another step forward in 2020, you'll be very happy to have the speedster in your lineup. He ended last season with a career-high 110 targets and is still on top of Seattle's WR depth chart so, in Week 1, he'll likely be the first receiver to catch the eye of Russell Wilson. Lock him in as a WR2 against the Falcons' mediocre pass defense.","Wilson has showed no signs of slowing down, as his per-game fantasy points average in 2019 was the third-best of his career. He has lots of injuries to contend with among his skill position players, but that's nothing new for the Wisconsin product. He's a reliable fantasy quarterback facing an Atlanta defense that was quite favorable for opposing passers last season. Lock him in as your starter.","From undrafted receiver to breakout tight end, Waller thrived as a steady target of Derek Carr last season. While he's unlikely to approach his awesome target clip last season, Waller should remain a fine fantasy starter heading into a matchup with a Carolina defense missing legendary cover linebacker Luke Kuechly. ",null,null,"As a defense, Baltimore led the league in blitzing while posting a solid turnover rate in the secondary. Given Baker Mayfield's struggles against pressure last season, Baltimore looks like a solid fantasy defense for this division matchup.","Likely to serve as the change-of-pace and third-down option aside Jordan Howard in the Miami backfield, Breida shouldn't be starting in fantasy lineups until we see just how his role and usage play out. It doesn't help his case that the Patriots were among the best defenses against backfields last season.","It seemed like Coleman would be the lead back for the 49ers last season, but injuries and the emergence of other options kept him as just a rotational option. As such, he had his worst-ever season from a fantasy scoring perspective, but flashed moments of the promise we remember from his days in Atlanta. It's always tough to pick a 49ers running back, but Raheem Mostert appears to be the one with the most fantasy potential, so Coleman should head to the fantasy bench as the second-in-line for prime opportunities.","A bit risky to begin the season as a fantasy option given a somewhat cloudy depth chart past Tyreek Hill for the Chiefs, Hardman enters the season with gobs of potential given his field-stretching speed in an offense that often rewards speed and playmaking. Not yet a usable flex play, it does help Hardman's case as a DFS target that the Texans struggled in the secondary last season in allowing the seventh-most fantasy points to receivers.","Drafted in the first round out of LSU, Jefferson appears to be the Vikings' replacement for the traded Stefon Diggs. He scored an incredible 18 touchdowns in 2019 for the Tigers and should slot right into an offense that is efficient, though lacking in a high ceiling. The Packers have an above-average pass defense (eighth in WR fantasy points allowed last season) and Bisi Johnson will be involved in Minnesota's offense, so there's every reason to take a cautious approach with the rookie in Week 1. The potential here is very high, though.","With so many of the Eagles' wideouts hurt, Goedert could be in line for a bigger role in Week 1 against Washington. Normally a team's No. 2 tight end lacks fantasy appeal, but Goedert is regularly involved in Philadelphia's passing game and finished the season with six-plus targets in each of his final eight contests. He's probably a bit too risky for most leagues, but given Washington's struggles to defend tight ends last season, there are worse gambles you could take.",null],"2":["Cook scored twice for the Vikings in Week 1, but touched the ball only 13 times on what was an interesting day for the Minnesota offense. They ran just 52 plays, compared to 78 for the Packers. The Vikings won't always get out-tempoed or outscored like that, and Cook remains one of the top options in fantasy football. He has a mediocre matchup in Week 2 against a Colts defense which allowed only 91 total rushing yards to the Jaguars in Week 1. That said, Cook is a must-start when healthy. Keep him in your lineup.","Jones jumped right back into his 2019 role to start the 2020 season, getting three red-zone rushing attempts and seeing four red-zone passing targets in Green Bay's Week 1 win. He has one of the most fantasy-friendly roles of any running back and is a great option to start in Week 2 against Detroit, who allowed 150 rushing yards to the Bears in Week 1.","The USC product caught all six of his targets for 69 yards and two touchdowns in an encouraging reunion with Ben Roethlisberger. The Broncos were gashed at times by the Titans' receivers in Week 1, lending some hope for Smith-Schuster to deliver another strong line.","Lockett was a major factor in the Seattle passing game in Week 1, picking up eight targets and hauling them all in for 92 total yards. His lack of end-zone visits is a tad worrisome, but the volume is there. Lockett has the big-play ability to win you a game on any given Sunday, even against a tough defense like New England's. Lock him in as a solid WR2. ","Wilson led all quarterbacks in fantasy scoring in Week 1, but faces a much tougher test in Week 2 against the Patriots. Ryan Fitzpatrick threw a trio of picks against New England in Week 1, but Wilson is obviously a superior passer. You should keep starting the Seattle signal-caller for the time being, even in tough matchups. He is one of the best options at his position and has proven to play well against fierce competition.","Even if his stat line looked a bit light, Waller still led the team in routes and targets against the Panthers. One of the rare full-time tight ends in the league, Waller will be plenty busy working against the Saints' exploitable back seven.",null,"An emboldening opener saw Allen become just the third Bills player ever to produce at least 300 yards in the air and 50 on the ground in the same game. With the most rushing scores among quarterbacks since joining the league, maybe Allen can mimic Cam Newton's success against a soft Dolphins defense.","Baltimore paced the NFL in Week 1 in creating pressure on Cleveland's passing game on 34.1% of dropbacks. Houston, meanwhile, has struggled in pass protection for much of Deshaun Watson's career. The point total for this game is found above 50, which isn't ideal for defensive purposes, but Baltimore's big-play potential merits interest from fantasy managers. ","Barely a factor in the game plan for his first game with the Dolphins, Brieda was third on the team in meaningful backfield touches. Somehow behind Myles Gaskin on the depth chart, it's best to simply stash Brieda ahead of a tough matchup with the Bills.","Coleman sits at No. 3 on the 49ers' RB depth chart coming out of Week 1. That's a sure sign to keep him benched in your fantasy leagues. Raheem Mostert is the star of the show at the moment and the fantasy darling of the San Francisco backfield.","A breakout sophomore season in the league isn't likely to materialize if Hardman continues to serve a low-volume role. Afforded just one target, and one well behind the line of scrimmage, Hardman wasn't afforded a real shot at production in Week 1. It doesn't seem like Hardman has scaled the depth chart or even the offense overall in terms of usage, thus Hardman isn't a bankable option for this tough division matchup.","Jefferson split snaps with Bisi Johnson in the Minnesota passing game, but both finished well behind Adam Thielen in terms of overall production to start the season. This offense appears to be led by Thielen and Dalvin Cook. None of the other Minnesota players provide much by way of fantasy upside. Keep an eye on Jefferson, but don't add him to your Week 2 lineups.","Goedert was the beneficiary of Washington's gameplan to keep Zach Ertz in check. He ended up reeling in eight balls for 101 yards and a score. The Rams will likely follow Washingtonâ€™s blueprint in Week 2, keying on Ertz while pressuring Carson Wentz. This sets Goedert up nicely for another productive week for both the Eagles and your fantasy squad.",null],"3":["It was a bad day all around for the Vikings offense in Week 2, but Cook still managed a decent fantasy total thanks to his rushing touchdown and pair of receptions. He's going to get a healthy number of opportunities every week and just has to hope his team is competitive enough to keep him involved as a runner and effective enough to give him scoring chances. Neither is guaranteed against Tennessee, but Cook is far too good to remove from your lineup at this point. Consider him as a solid RB1 against a team that allowed James Robinson to rush for 102 yards and a score a week ago.","With Davante Adams ailing, Aaron Rodgers and the Packers turned to their other star on offense in Week 2. He did not disappoint. Jones rushed for 168 yards, caught passes for another 68, and scored three times in a fantasy-matchup-winning performance. The Saints have been a bit tougher against the run than the pass over the past 18 games, but don't let that stop you from plugging in Jones as a solid RB2 (or even a low-end RB1) for the foreseeable future.","While he's been busy over the first two weeks, it's a bit concerning that so many of Smith-Schuster's targets come around the line of scrimmage. Without much downfield attention, Smith-Schuster becomes more dependant on reaching the end zone to be a fantasy force.","Lockett will be one of the primary beneficiaries of Russell Wilson's MVP-level play, having seen eight targets from one of the league's best passers in both of his first two games. That's a great spot to be in for a fantasy receiver, and it should stay golden in Week 3 against a Dallas defense that was embarrassed by the Falcons last week. Lock in Lockett as a top-tier WR1.","Wilson has scored nine touchdowns through two weeks and next faces a Dallas defense which allowed four scores to Matt Ryan in Week 2. Hopefully you weren't considering benching Wilson, who leads all quarterbacks in scoring this season, but just in case you were, let us reassure you. He's a must-start in Week 3 and beyond.","An awesomely productive Week 2 was fueled by a career-best 16 targets. We don't expect such amazing opportunity rates for this matchup with the Patriots, but it does help Waller's case that double-digit target shares are always within reach.",null,"Allen is the first Bills quarterback since Jim Kelly to open a season with consecutive 300-yard outings. Even as the Rams have proven solid on defense, Allen's dual-threat skill set earns him another big projection.","It's difficult to overlook a productive blitz-heavy defense such as Baltimore's, but if there were ever a week to look to say the Chargers or Browns as streaming options instead of this group, this would be it; the Chiefs present a unique challenge and rarely make it fun for opposing defenses.","Second on the Dolphins in backfield touches in Week 2, Breida appears more valuable at this stage than Jordan Howard. Then again, it's still Myles Gaskin who claims the most rewarding workload, leaving Brieda as a bench stash heading into this matchup with Jacksonville.","Coleman is expected to be out for a few weeks with an injury, so look to Raheem Mostert (if active) and Jerrick McKinnon to carry the load on offense for the 49ers in Week 3.","Sitting on just four targets on the season, it's hard to get too excited about Hardman's production potential as long as he serves such a limited complementary role with Kansas City. With a tough Baltimore secondary up next, Hardman remains merely a depth addition for fantasy purposes.","Jefferson did finish as Minnesota's top receiver in Week 2, but he managed only 44 yards in a horrible offensive output for the Vikings. He's playing in the No. 3 wide receiver role behind Adam Thielen and Bisi Johnson and will need a big boost in playing time to become a viable fantasy starter. Keep him benched for Week 3.","Goedert has registered two straight weeks with eight targets, securing a dozen catches for 131 yards and a touchdown -- and outproducing teammate and fellow TE Zach Ertz. While chances are good that Ertz's production will pick up, it's very apparent that Goedert should remain fantasy relevant in 2-TE sets. Goedert's volume makes him a matchup play with Week 3 being a good spot to use him against a leaky Bengals defense.",null],"4":["Cook had a truly breakout performance in Week 3, racking up 199 total yards and scoring a long touchdown for the Vikings.

The Green Bay back is a must-start most weeks, but that's certainly true against the stumbling Falcons.","This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","Lockett found paydirt three times in Week 3, while also hitting the 100-yard mark for the first time this season. More importantly, he has seen 29 targets through three weeks and is becoming more and more reliable as a top fantasy option. Against a weak Miami pass defense, lock him in as a solid WR1.","Wilson is head and shoulders above the league in terms of fantasy production so far this season, with 14 passing touchdowns and only one interception through three weeks of play. The Dolphins have allowed the third-most QB fantasy points so far this season, so this is a great chance to keep Wilson glued to your QB1 spot in fantasy.","Limited to a quiet outing with just two catches for nine yards this past week with the Patriots focusing on Waller, it's worth remembering he led the Raiders with 18 catches for 150 yards over the first two games. Due for a stronger showing against the Bills this week, Waller remains firmly in the TE1 mix.",null,"Fresh from becoming the first player in Bills history to produce at least four passing scores and one rushing score in consecutive games and just the second player in team history with three consecutive 300-yard outings, Allen is set to thrive as a playmaker against a Raiders defense that rates juts 28th in creating pressures per dropback.  ","The league's most aggressive blitz scheme always presents some value, especially against a green passer for Washington. With some turnover and sack potential in this matchup, Baltimore makes for one of the better plays at the position.","Limited to only three touches and four scrimmage yards, Brieda just isn't a threat to Myles Gaskin for meaningful touches at this stage. Seattle, meanwhile, has allowed the second-fewest yards on the ground to tailbacks.",null,"Averaging a team-high 20 air yards per game against the Ravens, Hardman was a big-play machine on Monday night. Yet with a limited batch of routes each week, Hardman is difficult to trust for fantasy purposes in a tough matchup with New England.","Jefferson had a breakout game in Week 3, hauling in 7-of-9 targets and picking up his first touchdown. All of a sudden, Jefferson has replaced Stefon Diggs across from Adam Thielen and fantasy managers will be faced with the difficult decision each week of predicting which Minnesota wideout will perform better. Against a solid Houston pass defense, we're trusting the veteran Thielen a bit more, but Jefferson is still worthy of a flex start in deeper leagues.","Geodert's left ankle is fractured. Doug Pederson said that the tight end will be out for an extended period of time.",null],"5":["Cook was dominant in Week 4, handling 29 total touches for 146 yards and a pair of touchdowns. That's what we've come to expect from the Minnesota back, but it was against a lackluster Houston run defense. Seattle is much stronger against the run, but that's no reason to think about benching or downgrading Cook. He's a solid RB1 for Week 5, assuming his injury absence for part of this past week's game is nothing to worry about moving forward.",null,"Sitting at only 9.4 yards per catch is the main holdup in declaring Smith-Schuster fully back into the WR1 tier. Strong red zone usage aids his case as a high-end option. If Darius Slay follows him around the field this week, there is a bit more risk, but a solid target share and rewarding role near the end zone supports a strong projection.","Lockett had a letdown of a performance in Week 4, limited to only four targets in a surprisingly inefficent game for Russell Wilson and the entire Seattle offense. Still, even an inefficient effort is enough to produce a victory and a big number on the scoreboard for the Seahawks -- and this team is unlikely to stumble twice in a row. Minnesota has allowed the fourth-most WR fantasy points this season, so keep Lockett locked into your lineups.","You're off to a very good start when you tie an all-time record for touchdowns through four weeks in an \"off game.\" Wilson struggled at times against Miami but still delivered a great performance from a fantasy standpoint. He will next take on the Vikings in Week 5, looking to continue his MVP campaign. Look, Wilson is a must-start in all leagues each and every week of the season that he plays.  Just don't forget his bye comes in Week 6!","Back to his target-rich role around the line of scrimmage with 11 targets, albeit on just five air yards per target, Waller was relatively stellar in Week 4. The Chiefs have been really solid in pass coverage this season, but Waller's volume-driven role merits trust in all formats.",null,"This surging MVP candidate survived an injury scare to his non-throwing shoulder in Week 4's win. Allen's 12 pass TD through four games ties  Ryan Fitzpatrick from 2012 for the most in franchise history through the first quarter of the season. Allen has completed 72% of his passes thrown at least 10 yards downfield this season, making a massive leap in vertical efficiency from his first two pro campaigns. The Titans present a challenge in that they rank fourth in the league in pressuring passers, but Allen's mobility and downfield creativity supports another QB1 projection.","Baltimore's defense hasn't proven stingy just yet this season, but it remains aggressive and productive. Third in the league with a 36.1% blitz rate per dropback and facing a rookie quarterback in Joe Burrow, Baltimore is in a great spot to meet or exceed their projection. ","Some big plays in the passing game helped Breida tally a solid day from scrimmage against Seattle this past week, but it's still telling he was held to just six touches and 17 snaps in the loss. Without a big role in a subpar offense facing a top defense, Brieda's bid for a fun revenge outing against the 49ers isn't looking good.",null,"His six-yard score in Week 4 marked the first of his nine career scores to come in under 20 yards. The field-stretching force won't see the ball enough against the Raiders to help fantasy rosters, but Hardman is still one of the more interesting insurance policies at receiver.","Jefferson has stepped into a bigger role in the Minnesota offense and made it count again in Week 4 with over 100 yards receiving. All four of his receptions were for 20-plus yards, a level of consistency that will be very appealing as he gets more and more looks going forward. He's a high-upside flex play against a Seattle defense that has allowed the most WR fantasy points thus far in 2020.",null,null],"6":["Cook's status for Week 6 is in serious doubt due to injury, so it is best for fantasy managers to seek other options if they had been planning to start the Minnesota back against Atlanta.

He simply has a knack for finding the end zone and is one of the safest choices at his position in fantasy. Against a Tampa Bay defense that has surprisingly struggled a bit to defend backs this season, he's a solid RB1 in all formats.","Is it officially time to reconsider Smith-Schuster's fantasy profile; atypically high touchdown production in the first few games has fueled some solid results, but it's becoming clear that he's not the alpha target hog many projected. Instead, he's part of a talented young corps that will likely compete for high-value targets each week. Smith-Schuster is still very much a fantasy starter in this role, especially in a matchup with a porous pass defense.",null,null,null,null,"Among the league's most productive vertical passers and always a threat to break a big run scrambling, Allen epitomizes the dual-threat nature of today's top fantasy quarterbacks. One Achilles heel for the Buffalo offense could be allowing a pressure rate around 30% to opponents, especially as this week's opponent, the Chiefs, rate fourth in the league in pressuring quarterbacks. ","Blitzing opponents on 38.4% of dropbacks, Baltimore is the third-most aggressive team when it comes to sending extra bodies at the pocket this season. Such a daring agenda can lead to some big plays for the opposition, but the Ravens are well positioned to deliver strong fantasy results this week against a porous patchwork Eagles offensive line.","Serving a similar complementary role to the one he played for the 49ers in recent seasons, Brieda reached double-digit touches for the first time this season in the blowout win over San Francisco. He is still behind Myles Gaskin in the depth, however, and should remain on the waiver wire for now.",null,"Surfacing as the team's third receiver the past two games thanks to overtaking Demarcus Robinson in routes run for consecutive weeks, Hardman has some real potential to ascend in the coming games due to an injury to Sammy Watkins, who has enjoyed a busy role on the outside of the Chiefs' offense thus far. If Watkins misses time, Hardman presents as a boom-or-bust option against a Buffalo secondary that ranks in the bottom half defending receivers this season.","Jefferson handled only five targets against Seattle in Week 5, with the entire Vikings passing game taking a back seat to Adam Thielen. That said, Minnesota will face Atlanta next, and the Falcons have allowed the most touchdowns in the air this season. Jefferson has the big-play potential to pay off as a flex pick in most leagues, especially if you're looking for a high-upside replacement for bye week players.",null,null],"8":["Cook's outlook for Week 8 is promising from a health perspective, as the bye week came at just the right time for the Vikings. The Packers allow the most RB fantasy points per game, making this a fine landing spot for the superstar back. The only thing that could limit him would be his injury or a blowout win for the Packers, but neither is likely enough to drop him from RB1 status for Week 8.","Jones' fantasy appeal for Week 8 will depend entirely on his health. If he's cleared to play -- and hopefully he is since he was a game-time decision in Week 7 -- then he's an RB1, thanks to consistent production this season of at least one touchdown in every start. Keep an eye on the injury report and be prepared to make a change but, for now, put him in as a starter.","A season-high 15 targets fueled a solid PPR outing for the USC product, marking his first game with at least nine catches since Week 16 of the 2018 campaign. Such target volume likely won't be available this week against the Ravens, but a solid share of the work supports WR3 expectations for Smith-Schuster.","Welcome back to \"Which Seattle Wideout WIll it Be?\" for yet another epsiode. In Week 7, it was Lockett who broke out of a bit of a slump to post a monster game, while DK Metcalf managed only a pair of receptions. Lockett had more than twice the targets in Week 7 against Arizona than he did in Weeks 4-5 combined. That's not unusual for Lockett and the Seahawks, but this is what you sign up for when you roster the playmaker. He's a solid starting option this week yet again, even against a tough San Francisco offense, but you're not going to feel comfortable until the catches come.","Wilson's MVP candidacy took a bit of a hit in Week 7, as he tossed a trio of interceptions against the Cardinals. He still managed to rack up a ton of fantasy points, though, thanks to 84 rushing yards and three passing touchdowns, but things don't get any easier in Week 8. The 49ers are in the top 10 at QB fantasy point prevention. Wilson, however, is far too good to bench and should stay locked into the starting spot in all lineups.","A touchdown and 25% share of targets last week cemented another solid week of usage and productionÂ for Waller. Arguably the only bankable receiving threat each week from this offense, Waller is in a good spot against a Cleveland defense that has struggled in coverage this season.",null,"Allen amassed strong yardage totals against the Jets, with his season-high 61 rushing yards helping buffer the absence of touchdowns. Next up is a meeting with division rivals out of New England. After struggling earlier in his career against man coverage, Allen is among the best in the league against such schemes this year. Given that the Patriots play man on 65% of opponent dropbacks, second most in the NFL, this should be a revealing matchup of strength-on-strength. ","The Ravens sacked Carson Wentz six times last time out and currently sit fourth in the league in pressure rate, but this matchup with the Steelers isn't really ideal for fantasy purposes given Pittsburgh's effectively conservative passing attack and solid rushing output. It's still fine to roll out Baltimore's D/ST given promising pass rush metrics, but there is some risk present given the matchup.","Breida continued to play second fiddle in Week 6, getting just eight touches for 22 yards against the Jets. With Tua Tagovailoa now having been named Miami's new starting quarterback, the Dolphins will likely keep things simple this week against the Rams, again relying on Myles Gaskin to do the heavy lifting out of the backfield.",null,"In a sense, Hardman maximized his opportunities with 57 yards on two targets last week, but it's conversely troubling he was sixth on team in routes, behind both Byron Pringle and Demarcus Robinson. Without a sizable role, you can't trust Hardman this week against the Jets.","We're not ready to declare Jefferson the No. 1 receiver in Minnesota yet, as Adam Thielen remains incredibly consistent, but Jefferson certainly has the Stefon Diggs-like upside we'd seen in previous years for the Vikings. That makes him a tougher pick in fantasy leagues -- a player with a low floor and high ceiling, but the gamble is usually worth it unless you have a loaded WR corps on your fantasy squad. Consider him as a solid WR3/flex this week against a good (but not great) Green Bay defense.",null,null],"9":["Cook looked to be rejuvenated following his injury absence and a bye week, setting season-highs in touches and touchdowns against the Packers in Week 8. Green Bay is the only team allowing more RB points per game than the Lions, Minnesota's Week 9 opponent, so make sure the FSU product remains in your starting lineup for the week ahead.","If Aaron Jones is fit to play on Thursday, he belongs in all fantasy lineups, even with the toughest fantasy matchup for running backs (San Francisco) on deck. He'd be the only back among the team's regular top-three options eligible to play, and would see the lion's share of volume. However, his status is far from certain for Week 9. Should he miss Thursday's action, the Packers would have to scramble to put together a plan at the RB position that would likely lack in fantasy appeal.","Most of his targets are still coming right around the line of scrimmage, but Smith-Schuster is catching plenty of them to help maintain PPR value. The ceiling seems pretty low for the former big-play maven, though, with Diontae Johnson and Chase Claypool seemingly ahead in line for high-value vertical looks. This said, a nice matchup with a porous pass defense this week helps Smith-Schuster's case a flex option.","The Seattle receiver lottery came up in DK Metcalf's favor in Week 8, but that's just a part of the game for fantasy managers who roster one of the team's top-tier duo of wideouts. Lockett has a pair of 3-TD performances and can be a matchup-winner when he's on his game, so keep him locked into starting lineups this week against the Bills.","It's unlikely that you're considering benching Russell Wilson at this point, as the MVP candidate continues to post huge numbers week after week. A matchup with Buffalo raises no red flags for the veteran signal-caller, as the Bills allow opposing quarterbacks to score more points per game than San Francisco -- and Wilson just scored four touchdowns against the 49ers.","The most bankable and projectable receiver on the Raiders each week, Waller could feast on a Chargers back seven that has allowed the 10th-most fantasy points per game to tight ends. Given this blend of positive matchup and usage data, Waller is among the top plays at his position this week.",null,"After throwing for multiple scores in each of his first five games this season, Allen has failed to do so in consecutive outings. A rushing score helped Allen's case last week, but a return to big passing production could come this week with Seattle among the most generous pass defenses in league history. In an ideal setup for passing output, Allen is among the top plays of the week.","With at least six fantasy points in all but one outing this season, Baltimore's D/ST is the rare group worth deploying on a weekly basis. The Colts are solid against opposing pass rushes on offense, but there is some potential fantasy fun facing Philip Rivers' interception rate.","Phased out of the offense of late, Breida handled just eight snaps out of a potential 49 this past week. With the team relying on Myles Gaskin on most downs, this change-of-pace back is merely an insurance policy heading into a meeting with the Cardinals.","Coleman appears to have re-injured the knee that kept him out of action for most of the first-half of the season. Even if it's not the same injury, expect the 49ers to be careful with their starting back, especially with the backups performing admirably in his absence. As such, look for alternative plans for Week 9 with the veteran likely sidelined.","A big leap in usage helped Hardman produce one of the better games of his career this past week. The speedster ran ahead of Demarcus Robinson and Byron Pringle for the first time in weeks and tallied a season-high seven catches in the win. It's unclear if Hardman will play such a big role in the passing game this week against the Panthers, a somewhat solid pass defense. It's worth stashing Hardman to see if this bigger role is enduring.","Jefferson caught only three passes in Week 8 as the Vikings were able to hand off the ball over and over in a win over the Packers. They should be able to run early and often against the Lions in Week 9, as well, meaning Jefferson is a very risky pick -- despite his solid outings in the weeks leading up to Minnesota's bye.

Things get a bit tougher this week against Chicago, who have an above-average run defense, but that's no reason to downgrade Cook from your starting lineup.","Jones returned from injury to lead a thin Green Bay backfield in Week 9, and with an extra long week to recover, he should be good to go for Week 10 against a porous Jacksonville defense. With four games of 20 or more touches in six starts, Jones is one of the safest and most productive backs in fantasy and belongs in all lineups this week.","A season-high 93 yards and his first score since Week 3 fueled a big game against the Cowboys for this USC product. While he's still arguably third in line for meaningful attention behind Chase Claypool and Diontae Johnson in this passing offense, Smith-Schuster's steady snap and route rates help fuel flex value for this still-valuable wideout.","The Seattle receiver roller-coaster continued in Week 9, as Lockett managed only four receptions for 40 yards against a tough Buffalo defense while DK Metcalf posted huge numbers and David Moore outpaced him, as well. Lockett is going to win fantasy managers a few more matchups this season, so be patient and keep him in your lineup, even for this week's tough matchup against the Rams.","Wilson had his worst fantasy outing in over a month against the Bills, but still racked up almost 400 passing yards and scored a trio of touchdowns. Even his poorest outings are solid fantasy days and he's a must-start in all leagues, even against a Rams pass defense allowing the fourth-fewest points per game to opposing passers.","The most bankable skill player on the Raiders this season, Waller salvaged an inefficient Week 9 with a visit to the end zone. The rival Broncos are up next and while Denver has proven respectable in covering tight ends, awesome target volume and a rewarding red zone role continue to drive TE1 expectations for Waller.",null,"Allen became just the first Bills quarterback with multiple regular-season games with at least 400 passing yards and three scores, while franchise legend Jim Kelly had two such games.

His status is questionable when the Dolphins entertain the Chargers this Sunday. If Breida is able to suit up, the matchup is favorable enough to consider him as a flex option.","If Coleman is cleared to play in Week 10, he'd likely be the top option across the entire San Francisco offense ' against one of the toughest run defenses in football.

Capable of building a big box score via both the run and the pass, Allen is poised for a strong showing against a Chargers defense allowing 20.1 fantasy points per game to quarterbacks, a rate that sits seventh-highest in the NFL.","The Titans dropped 30 points on the Ravens this past week, with only the Chiefs' 34 back in Week 3 as the higher tally from a Baltimore opponent this season. A key issue of late for this defense has been a dormant pass rush, with the Ravens totaling just three sacks the past three weeks. It's fine to roll this group out there against the Steelers given they delivered a respectable six fantasy points against Pittsburgh back in Week 8, but with Ben Roethlisberger getting the ball out so quickly this season, expectations for this pass rush should be tempered.","In his return from injury this past week, Breida touched the ball just twice and wasn't involved at all in the passing phase. It appears Salvon Ahmed is the team's lead back, leaving Breida in fantasy free agency for this matchup with New York.","Coleman has barely seen the field this season, but could make his way back to the lineup for Week 12 against the Rams. However, Raheem Mostert is also on track to return soon -- and he would be the superior fantasy option, should he suit up alongside Coleman.

It was his fifth game with either a score or 100 total yards. Week 12 will be interesting for Jefferson, who will face a Carolina defense that will offer more resistance than the Cowboys did the week before. However, he may also be tasked with No. 1-receiver duties for Minnesota, as Adam Thielen has been placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list.

He now has 75-plus yards from scrimmage and/or a touchdown in every game this season. The Eagles have a strong defensive front against the run, but not nearly strong enough to keep Jones from racking up more yards and potentially finding paydirt once again. He's a great choice as an RB1 in all leagues.","While he led the Steelers in routes this past week, a low average depth of target and lack of creation with the ball in his hands led to Smith-Schuster finishing fourth on the team in receiving yardage.

That's just how this offense is at times, and fantasy managers have to show patience and wait for Lockett's turn to dominate the volume and production. That could come this week against the Giants, who have a mediocre pass defense. Start Lockett with confidence.","Wilson has not been posting the sort of week-winning fantasy numbers we've come to expect, and Monday night's win over the Eagles was certainly a disappointment for those needing a late rally to win pivotal Week 12 matchups. Don't lose faith, as the MVP candidate is still the same, capable passer he's always been. He will rebound at some point down the stretch. It could be this week against the Giants, although New York is among the top-10 fantasy QB defenses. Still, trust Wilson in your starting lineups.","This past week against the Falcons might just be a throwaway game in that Derek Carr was off from the start and the Falcons defense was surprisingly relentless. This all led to Waller producing his second-lowest fantasy tally of the year. Thankfully, a softer matchup awaits with the Jets allowing 14.6 fantasy points per game to tight ends, right around Waller's strong projection this week.",null,"The Chargers' relentless pass rush and strong secondary limited Allen to a modest passing day, but he produced yet another game with a passing and rushing score and now is second only to Cam Newton in games with at least one rush and passing score in his first three seasons. Given his unique dual-threat ability, Allen is positioned as a solid fantasy starter even with the 49ers up next.","Missing the defense's top pass rusher in Week 12 wasn't ideal, but there is still enough talent on this Ravens' defense to consider this group a solid fantasy option for this matchup with a Dallas team struggling to both protect and move the ball.","Breida opened last week's game looking like the team's top option out of the backfield, but quickly ceded snaps and touches to DeAndre Washington, who led the backfield in touches in the win over the Jets. Given he wasn't even able to get meaningful work with Salvon Ahmed and Myles Gaskin sidelined, it's best to avoid Breida for this matchup with a weak Bengals rush defense.","Coleman may have missed his window to make a major impact on the San Francisco offense, as Raheem Mostert returned to the field and made big waves in his first game back. Even if Coleman plays this week, he'll likely serve only in a support role to Mostert and shouldn't be in your plans for fantasy.","On the field for fewer than a third of the Chiefs' offensive snaps this past week, Hardman will have a hard time producing relevant numbers in such a limited role. The Broncos field a respectable pass defense, adding to the fade for this second-year option.","Jefferson is truly thriving in the \"Stefon Diggs\" role in the Minnesota offense, finding big plays and stepping up when Adam Thielen is unavailable. Don't worry about a loss in volume when Thielen returns either, as Jefferson has established himself as a trusted target in this offense and should be considered as a WR2/WR3 from here on out. He gets an upgrade to the left side of that slash against a porous Jacksonville defense in Week 13.","Goedert found paydirt for the second straight week, leading the Eagles in receiving during Week 12's Monday night affair with the Seahawks. Goedert hauled in 7-of-10 targets for 75 yards in addition to the score. He has certainly stepped up with Zach Ertz sidelined. Even if Ertz is able to suit up in Week 13's visit to Green Bay, Goedert is still one of the better options at a beleaguered position.",null],"14":["Cook handled 32 rushing attempts and nine targets in Week 13. You don't need to know anything else to lock him in as your top running back for Week 14. The Vikings rely heavily on the FSU product and give him as many touches as he can handle, so even against a very good Tampa Bay run defense, he's a must-start in all leagues and formats.","Even in one of the best passing offenses in the NFL, Jones continues to get it done on the ground, posting huge numbers in Week 13 and handling 14-plus touches for the 10th straight game this season. He's consistent, a goal-line priority for his offense, and has big-play potential. Against the Lions, one of the weakest run-defending teams in football, he's a must play in all formats and leagues.","Netting 28 yards on 10 targets is an ugly outcome for Smith-Schuster, but is also simply part of how he's been used so often around the line of scrimmage this season. Without much downfield work, Smith-Schuster's ceiling is fairly low for this meeting with the Bills.","While it has felt like every week of late has been a DK Metcalf week, Lockett has quietly handled nine targets in three of the last four games. He's not making the huge plays, nor is he posting the matchup-winning fantasy numbers of his younger teammate, but he's still more than good enough to command a spot among your starting receivers against a porous Jets secondary.","Wilson's MVP candidacy and fantasy stock have taken a hit in recent weeks, with only four touchdowns (compared to five turnovers) over his last four games. He hasn't gone over 300 yards passing in any of those contests and fell short of a 70% completion rate in two of those games. The good news is that there were some tougher matchups mixed in there, and this week's contest with the Jets should be much easier for him. If you got this far with Wilson, you have to stick with him in this gem of a matchup against New York.","It's possible the Jets forgot that Waller is really good or that he was even on the field, as the Raiders' top target went off for a career outing that included a whopping 200 yards -- a tally good for the sixth-most ever in a game for a tight end. The Colts have been generally great against the pass this season, but Waller's unique usage elevates him to must-start status for Week 14.",null,"Allen posted his third game with four passing scores this season to match Jim Kelly (1994) for the most in a single season in Bills history. The Steelers present a real challenge given such a relentless pass rush, but Allen's dual-threat ability and vertical proficiency still support a strong projection.","Facing the Browns hasn't been so rewarding for fantasy defenses this season; D/ST units are averaging just 3.9 fantasy points facing the run-heavy Browns. While this blitz-happy group can create splash plays, there is some risk given the nature of the opponent.",null,"Coleman barely registered for the 49ers in Week 13, with Jeff Wilson Jr. and Raheem Mostert handling most of the fantasy output from the backfield. The veteran doesn't seem to be in a position to contribute as a starter in fantasy anytime soon.","Barely on the field this past Sunday, Hardman secured just one of his three targets in the win over Denver. Miami has been just a bit better than league average in defending receivers this season, while Hardman's small role should see him left in free agency.","Jefferson has emerged as an elite fantasy receiver in recent weeks -- and not only when Adam Thielen is on the sidelines. He has double-digit targets in three of the last four games and has scored four touchdowns over that span. Thielen and Jefferson are among the better WR duos in the NFL and both are viable WR1 options against a Tampa Bay defense that is soft against the pass.","Even with Zach Ertz back on the field in Week 13, Goedert's solid play continued as he brought in 5-of-7 targets for 66 yards. He failed to find paydirt for the first time in three weeks, but nevertheless showed he's still a fantasy factor. Goedert should continue to get looks in Week 14, but against a Saints defense yielding the 10th-fewest TE fantasy points per game, he's only a low- end TE1.",null],"15":["Even in a frustrating loss marred by untimely penalties, missed kicks, and sacks, Cook went over 100 yards in Week 14 and found the end zone for the Vikings. He's one of few constants in fantasy football, especially at running back, and he should be locked into your lineup every week, regardless of the matchup. Yes, Chicago is solid against the run, but Cook went over 100 total yards the last time he faced them. Trust that he will do so again in Week 15.","He didn't post impressive yardage totals or get into the end zone, but Jones handled another 17 touches in Week 14 and continues to lead the way out of the backfield for the Packers. Keep the faith and trust him with a spot in your lineup this week against a porous Carolina run defense.","In some ways he's become Jarvis Smith-Schuster in that almost all of this receiver's work comes around the line of scrimmage in this quick-hitting Pittsburgh passing game. The upside shot here is how poorly the Bengals are playing, setting up this USC product as a solid flex play.","Lockett's role in the Seattle offense has diminished with DK Metcalf surging to star status. Lockett has only scored a single touchdown over the past seven games, and has not gone over 70 yards in any of those contests. However, the potential is there for a huge game from the speedy receiver. In what should be a tight matchup with Washington, he's still worthy of a flex spot in most leagues given his tremendous upside.","After a month of matchups against top pass defenses, Wilson rebounded with a solid showing against the Jets in Week 14, tossing four touchdowns to match his total from Weeks 11-13 combined. However, he's back to facing tougher matchups for the rest of the season, starting with Week 15 against Washington. Even at his worst, Wilson offers a floor that's as high as any quarterback in fantasy, so keep him in your QB1 spot for this week's matchup.","A weekly force at the position, Waller is the No. 2 fantasy option at tight this season and should be in lineups every week even when facing a respectable crew of safeties like the Chargers claim.",null,"Allen was able to produce QB1 results against the league's top pass rush and a defense allowing the second-fewest fantasy points top passers on the season. Now up to 28 passing scores on the season, Allen is just five shy of Jim Kelly's franchise record. Denver's defensive reputation doesn't fully extend to quarterback production, as they've allowed more than 18 fantasy points per game to signal-callers, supporting a robust projection for Allen this week.","The blitz-happy Ravens didn't influence the Browns' offense very much this past week, but a choice setup against a subpar Jacksonville passing combined with added pressure could result in some fun fantasy results.",null,"Coleman has seen the field for only six offensive snaps over the past two games, so even if Raheem Mostert is out for Week 15, it's difficult to trust that Coleman will be the player to step up and produce in his absence.","Yet to really see the field enough in an offense that mostly deploys him as a vertical decoy, Hardman isn't a worthy fantasy option heading into a difficult matchup with New Orleans.","In Week 14, Jefferson had his first quiet game in over a month, and it was mostly a byproduct of the Buccaneers' ability to rush Kirk Cousins and keep him out of rhythm. The same could be true again in Week 15 against the Bears, who are much tougher against the pass than Tampa Bay. That said, Jefferson has earned weekly starting status thanks to his playmaking ability and upside. He's a solid WR2 in all formats, but now we know the downside that sits across from his upside.","Goedert's Week 14 production dipped a bit from his previous two games as Philadelphia focused on the ground game in their win over New Orleans. The tight end caught 4-of-6 looks for 43 yards against a stout Saints defense. The Cardinals present a more favorable Week 15 foe so look for Goedert to return to low-end TE1 numbers.",null],"16":["If you're still invested in your fantasy team in Week 16 and have Dalvin Cook on your roster, you know what to do here. Even against an elite New Orleans run defense, Cook is a fantasy superstar who delivers strong volume and a high chance of a touchdown every week. He's an RB1 in all formats.","Facing a defense weaker against the run than pass, Jones became the focal point for the Green Bay offense in Week 15. He racked up 24 touches against the Panthers and collected over 150 total yards and a touchdown for another solid fantasy output. The Titans are similarly poor against the run, meaning this is a great chance to look to Jones as a matchup-winner for you in fantasy.","A costly fumble and utter lack of receiving efficiency plagued Smith-Schuster's Week 15, resulting in his worst showing of the season. The Colts have allowed just the 10th-fewest fantasy points to receivers, although Smith-Schuster's target volume does support a bounce-back outing this week.","Lockett has fallen from a must-start WR1 with huge upside to a middling WR3/flex play. However, he still has that huge upside. His volume and production have dropped in recent weeks with the Seahawks facing tough matchups, and it gets no easier this week against the Rams. Consider Lockett to be a risky option for this tough contest, but one to start if you need to \"go for it.\"","Wilson's tough stretch of defensive matchups to end the season began as expected, with Washington limiting him to a season-low 121 yards through the air. The veteran signal-caller will now face an even tougher defense from Los Angeles. As tough as it might be for some, it's time to relegate Wilson to the bench in fantasy. If you're still in contention this week and have Wilson, you should search the waiver wire for the best available passer and seek a better matchup.","Waller is a baller. We just came up with that. In another awesome outing, Waller produced at least 150 receiving yards for the second time this year and became just the fourth tight end with multiple such performances in a season in the Super Bowl era. The Dolphins have a ball-hawking secondary, but Waller is clearly a must-start option.",null,"Saving his best statistical performance of the season for the heart of the fantasy playoffs, Allen delivered a season-high in fantasy points in helping the Bills secure the team's first division crown since 1995, a year before he was born. Allen became the first Bills player in franchise history with multiple games with two passing and two rushing scores and now sits just three passing scores behind Jim Kelly to tie the franchise record. The Patriots slowed down Allen to his lowest fantasy output of the season back in Week 8, but his recent stretch of production merits trust in all lineups this week.","Tallying a solid dozen fantasy points in downing the Jaguars this past week, Baltimore's D/ST enters Week 16 with momentum and arguably an even better matchup; only the Jets have seen opposing defenses average more fantasy points than the Giants this season.",null,"With both Raheem Mostert and Jeff Wilson Jr. injured, Coleman stepped into action for the 49ers in Week 15 and handled three carries. If both of his teammates are out this week, Coleman figures to split lead-back duties with Jerick McKinnon. Unfortunately, the former Falcon has not done enough with his chances this season to trust him with a spot in your fantasy lineup.","Only able to corral three of his nine targets this past week, at least one of them went for a touchdown in the back of the end zone on a brilliant throw by Patrick Mahomes. The Falcons have been awful at defending receivers this season, although Hardman enters the game with a very low floor given his complementary role as a vertical threat.","Jefferson is the lead receiver for the Vikings at this point, with steady targets and big production over the past couple of months while Adam Thielen has taken a step back. The Saints are tough to run against and slightly more vulnerableto the pass, so expect the rookie to be a big factor if Minnesota does anything on offense this week. He's a WR1 in all formats.","While Goedert was still involved in the Eagles' offense in Week 15, his four catches for 39 yards marked his lowest output since Week 10, even as his eight targets tied Jalen Reager for the team high. Despite the down performance, Goedert continues to be one of the better TE options for Week 16, though he'll face a tough challenge. The Cowboys have limited the TE position to the ninth-fewest fantasy points per game.",null],"17":["Even with only 17 touches to his name -- his lowest total since Week 2 -- Cook delivered over 80 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown against a tough Saints run defense in Week 16. The Lions provide the exact opposite in terms of matchup, so fantasy managers should expect one final huge game out of their superstar running back in Week 17.","Jones was kept off the field more than usual in Week 16 as the Packers won handily, but he still managed to go over 100 yards from scrimmage in limited playing time. That's why he has to remain locked into your lineups in Week 17, even against a solid Chicago run defense.","In Ben Roethlisberger's final start of the regular season, both Diontae Johnson and Smith-Schuster netted double-digit targets and both entered the end zone.","It was DK Metcalf who was the star of the show the last time the Seahawks played the 49ers, and Lockett has had only one solid showing of his own since that Week 8 game. He's due for a breakout game eventually, but fantasy managers may not see it happen until the postseason. He's worth a speculative start in the flex spot given his role and upside, but feel free to pursue a safer option if you're favored in your fantasy matchup.","Wilson cobbled together a decent fantasy output in Week 16 thanks to a rushing touchdown, but otherwise continued his trend of lackluster passing numbers to close the season. The defensive matchups have been brutal for the Seattle signal-caller of late, and that remains true in Week 17 against the 49ers. However, the last time these teams met, Wilson tossed four touchdowns. The Seahawks still have playoff implications on the line, so trust the veteran to rebound in this all-important final game of the regular season.","An awesome finish to the season has helped Waller deliver his second straight 1,000-yard campaign, as he joins Todd Christensen as the only Raidersâ€™ tight ends with multiple seasons in the 1K club. The Broncos limited Waller to a sluggish game earlier this year, but his undeniable momentum keeps him as a top play this week.",null,"The Bills just swept the season series against the Patriots for first time since 1999 while Allen became the first Bills player in franchise history with four scores and zero interceptions against the Patriots. Already the owner the franchise record for the most passing scores in a season, Allen will look to build on his magical campaign in a meeting with a Miami defense he torched for more than 430 total yards and four scores earlier this season.","Baltimore sacked Daniel Jones six times in the second half of last weeks' game after getting to him once in the first half. The Ravens turned up the pressure by blitzing Jones on 24-of-35 dropbacks (69%) in the second frame. With Baltimore ranked second in blitz rate on the season and the Bengals allowing the third-highest sack rate in the NFL, the Ravens' D/ST is poised for another solid showing.",null,"Coleman barely saw the field in Week 16 and is a part-time backup to Jeff Wilson Jr. in the 49ers' backfield. The former Falcon shouldn't be in your fantasy plans for the last week of the season.","This young speedster should see an expanded role given the team's aim of resting the starters. With Patrick Mahomes likely to rest, Hardman's floor and ceiling aren't so impressive against a Chargers defense that has allowed the fifth-fewest fantasy points to receivers.","Jefferson has seen double-digit targets in five of his last seven games and will look to put a bow on his impressive rookie campaign with a big game against the Lions. He's an easy choice to start in all leagues for this final week of play.","Goedert was in the midst of a quiet Week 16, catching only three balls for 38 yards, when an ankle injury forced him to the sidelines during the fourth quarter against Dallas. Goedert is now questionable for Philadelphia's season finale against Washington and an extremely risky play since the contest is on Sunday night, meaning there are likely no alternatives left to swap him out for if he's inactive.",null],"7":[null,"Jones had his worst outing of the season in Week 6 with only 15 yards on 10 carries but, in typical Aaron Jones fashion, he did find the end zone. He also handled 13 touches in a blowout loss, which is as sure a sign as any that he'll be right back atop the Packers' RB depth chart and hoping to extend his scoring streak to six games against the Texans this week. Houston allows the fourth-most RB fantasy points, so trust Jones as a top-end RB1 despite his disappointing performance against Tampa Bay.","Even as he led the team in routes run this past week, Smith-Schuster has become a somewhat forgettable fantasy option. If the trends from the first quarter of the season continue, with Chase Claypool and James Washington earning more exciting targets and Diontae Johnson consuming more targets, Smith-Schuster is positioned as a somewhat risky flex option. For this week, at least the specific matchup is enticing, with the Titans allowing nearly 200 yards per game to receiving corps. ","Lockett posted a pair of disappointing performances heading into Seattle's bye week, with only 83 yards on six grabs across two games. His volume also dipped -- a concerning trend against a pair of lackluster defenses. Arizona is a bit tighter against the pass than the Dolphins or Vikings, and DK Metcalf's emergence as a star wideout doesn't seem likely to slow down. Nevertheless, you should still trust Lockett as a fantasy starter with tons of big-play potential in Week 7.","One of the leading MVP candidates in the early going, Wilson will face a tough test against a divisional rival as the Cardinals host the Seahawks in Week 7. Arizona looked impressive against Dallas on Monday night, but Wilson has more than enough talent to rise to the challenge. He is an automatic QB1 start every week, but seems even more appealing after having posted 19 touchdowns in his five games before the bye week.","With twice as many receptions as any of his teammates, Waller is the clear top target on an underrated Las Vegas passing offense. This week offers a unique challenge given that Tampa Bay is one of the tougher pass defenses in the league, but Waller's awesome target share keep him in the starting mix.",null,"A rough patch these past few weeks against superior AFC opponents saw real regression hit Allen and the Buffalo offense. Then again, his rushing ability helps support a fairly high fantasy floor, while we already know of his stellar statistical ceiling. A nice matchup awaits Allen as he looks to regain early-season form in a meeting with the hapless Jets.

career has thus far been marred by injuries, but we saw a glimpse of his ceiling during a breakout 2019 campaign. Through Week 14, Cook led the league in rushing touchdowns and trailed only Christian McCaffrey in fantasy points. Cook missed two games and chunks of others but still finished no lower than ninth among backs in carries, receptions, touches, scrimmage yards and touchdowns. Cook's 15 carries inside the 5 were third most in the league, and he scored at least one touchdown in 11 of 14 games. Cook has now missed 19 games because of injury in three seasons, but there's no doubt the 24-year-old is positioned well as run-heavy Minnesota's primary back. He's a strong RB1 despite the durability concerns.","It's fair to say Jones was finally 'freed' in 2019. Green Bay's lead back set career-high marks in nearly every category, exploding for 1,558 yards (seventh most among RBs) and a league-high 19 touchdowns from scrimmage. Jones posted more duds than you'd expect from a top fantasy back (five weekly finishes outside the top 30), but still managed the second-most points at the position. Jones is a near lock for major touchdown regression this season, as his 19 TDs were nearly double his 10.8 OTD. Still, his strong efficiency and role as lead back in the Packers' offense is enough to allow the 25-year-old Jones solid RB1 numbers.","Smith-Schuster enters 2020 looking to bounce back after a rough 2019 season marred by Ben Roethlisberger's season-ending injury in Week 2, as well as various injuries of his own. After pacing all wide receivers in routes run and finishing top 10 in targets, receptions, receiving yards, end-zone targets and fantasy points during a breakout 2018 campaign, Smith-Schuster was held to a 41-542-3 line in 12 games of \"QB purgatory\" last season. Smith-Schuster is still only 23 years old and a strong bet for a rebound season with Roethlisberger back in action. Consider him to be a WR2 with upside.","The 2019 season was Lockett's fifth in the NFL, but his first as Seattle's clear No. 1 wide receiver. It's safe to say he handled himself well, playing through a midseason injury and reaching career-high marks in targets, receptions and yardage. Whereas teammate DK Metcalf paced the NFL in end-zone targets, Lockett finished fourth with 13. Lockett has finished second in catch rate and no lower than 16th in fantasy points both of the past two seasons. His 18 touchdowns are second most at the position during that span. Lockett enters his age-27 season as one of the game's most-efficient receivers and Russell Wilson's top target. He's a solid WR2.","The 2019 season was a tale of two halves for Wilson. He was the top-scoring fantasy QB through Week 6 but was held to three top-12 weeks and the 11th-most points the rest of the season. At the end of the day, he had his eighth top-11 fantasy campaign in as many tries, which includes four top-three seasons since 2014. Wilson remains a force with his legs (he's ranked no lower than ninth among QBs in rushing yards in his career), but he's also ranked top-three in passing touchdowns (33.3 per season) in each of the past three seasons. With Tyler Lockett, second-year receiver DK Metcalf and newcomer Greg Olsen at his disposal, the 31-year-old Wilson remains a solid QB1.","Waller's breakout 2019 season marked one of the most improbable breakout campaigns you'll ever see. Waller was drafted in the sixth round of the 2015 draft as a 6-foot-6 wide receiver. He barely saw the field while dealing with addiction but got back on his feet as a tight end with the Raiders. An absolute force from the get-go, Waller finished no lower than fourth among tight ends in snaps, routes, targets, receptions, yardage or YPT. Waller was held to three touchdowns (3.9 OTD) but finished third in fantasy points. The 27-year-old is Derek Carr's top target and positioned well for another high-volume season. He's a top-five fantasy tight end.","Zuerlein signed with the Cowboys during the offseason following eight seasons with the Rams. Fantasy's top-scoring kicker back in 2017, 'Greg the Leg' has finished just outside the top 10 in each of the past two seasons. Zuerlein's accuracy has been all over the place throughout his career. He nailed 95.0% of his field goals in 2017, but fell to 87.1% in 2018 and a horrific 72.7% last season. On the plus side, Zuerlein was one of only a handful of kickers who didn't miss an extra point last season, and Dallas has finished among the top five in field goal attempts in each of the past two seasons. The 32-year-old is worth a flier in the last round.","Allen is the perfect example of why rushing is so important when it comes to QB fantasy evaluations. The 2018 first-round pick finished as fantasy's No. 6 QB last season despite ranking 23rd in passing yards, 21st with only 20 passing TDs, third worst in completion percentage (59%) and 11th worst in YPA (6.7). Of course, Allen also produced a 109-510-9 rushing line and has now paced the position in rushing TDs in each of his two NFL seasons (17 total). Allen's passing troubles remain a red flag, but the addition of Stefon Diggs should help his cause. As long as he keeps running, Allen will be a back-end QB1 option.","The Ravens lost a ton of top-end talent during the 2019 free-agency period and it showed early, but quality coaching and a few in-season transactions turned things around and allowed their D/ST a third consecutive top-four fantasy season. Baltimore ranked fourth in yardage allowed, third in points allowed and second in D/ST touchdowns, with six. The 2020 offseason brought another exodus of key defenders, including Brandon Carr, Michael Pierce and Patrick Onwuasor, but the additions of Calais Campbell, Derek Wolfe and first-round pick Patrick Queen, as well as the return of Tavon Young to a loaded secondary, sets this unit up for another strong campaign. Consider the Ravens' D/ST a solid starting option.","Breida was traded to the Dolphins and is expected to share backfield duties with Jordan Howard this season. The former 49ers' rotational back has at least 105 carries in each of his three NFL seasons and has ranked no lower than 13th in yards per carry in each of those campaigns. His 5.0 YPC in that span ranks third among 42 backs with 300-plus carries. Breida hasn't done much after contact (1.5 YAC) or as a receiver (91 career targets) but has shown to be an explosive playmaker, which makes the 190-pound back a terrific complement to the 230-pound Howard. Consider Breida a bench option with a shot at flex production.","Coleman opened the 2019 season as the 49ers' lead back but was all but replaced atop the depth chart by Raheem Mostert down the stretch and during the playoffs. Coleman returns to San Francisco in 2020 but simply can't be counted on as a reliable starter. On one hand, it's a good situation, as 49ers' backs led the NFL in rushing yards (2,051) and touchdowns (19) last season. On the other hand, Jimmy Garoppolo didn't target the position much (20th in the category), and job security is almost nonexistent in Kyle Shanahan's offense. Coleman will compete with Mostert and Jerick McKinnon for snaps. Consider him a bench option.","Hardman was limited to 44% of the Chiefs' offensive snaps and a grand total of 41 targets during his rookie season. The 2019 second-round pick provided his fair share of explosive plays with a 26-538-6 receiving line, which provides plenty of optimism for the 23-year-old's future in Kansas City's elite offense. Hardman's short-term outlook is a bit cloudy with both Sammy Watkins and Demarcus Robinson returning, but Hardman is just one depth-chart adjustment or injury away from working as one of Patrick Mahomes' primary targets. You may not be able to start him much early on, but Hardman is an excellent upside target in the mid-to-late rounds.","Minnesota used the 22nd pick of April's draft to select Jefferson ' the de facto replacement for Stefon Diggs. Jefferson is 6-foot-1, 202 pounds with outstanding ball skills and contested-catch ability. The former LSU Tiger also has decent wheels (4.43 40), though he doesn't stand out in terms of perimeter separation or against press, which helps explain why he aligned in the slot 90% of the time in 2019. With only Adam Thielen ahead of him on the depth chart, Jefferson won't be short of playing time as a rookie, which isn't new for the player who paced the FBS with 111 receptions in 2019. Jefferson's 83% catch rate and 18 touchdowns were best in this year's rookie class. Jefferson's short-term upside will be limited by Minnesota's run-heavy offense, but he's still worth a late-round pick.","Goedert spent the 2019 season behind Zach Ertz on the depth chart and missed a game, but still managed a top-10 finish among tight ends in targets, receptions, yardage, touchdowns and fantasy points. A big reason for the high-end production was a massive number of injuries to Eagles' wide receivers and that shows up in Goedert's splits. The 2018 second-round pick posted five top-10 fantasy weeks, but four came after the team's Week 10 bye. Goedert appears to have a bright future, but the 25-year-old will struggle for TE1 numbers barring an Ertz injury.

hit the 1,000-yard mark in 2019 in only 13 games, as he was slowed by injuries but still produced at a high level. He chipped in as a receiver as well, and has demonstrated over his first two seasons that he's an every-down contributor who will only be held back by ailments or his team's offense. The Steelers had a top-five run defense last season when it came to stopping opposing backs from scoring fantasy points, but Barkley is matchup-proof. Start him every week.","About as dynamic of a big-play threat at his position in the league, Hill enters his fifth professional season with a proven rapport with the league's top passing talent. Seems like a good setup for fantasy fun, especially when opening the season against a Houston defense that struggled to contain outside speed last season.","Carson sits atop Seattle's RB depth chart heading into 2020. While the team did add a pair of backs in Carlos Hyde and draftee DeeJay Dallas, Carson is the lead back by any measure and should continue to build on his back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons. He even got a bit more involved in the passing game last season, which was very encouraging and more than enough reason to lock him in as an RB2 for Week 1 against the Falcons.","Murray finished 2019 with the eighth-most points among quarterbacks, but ended the season with 13-or-fewer points in four of his final five outings. He did well against the 49ers last season and he'll get a chance to face them again in Week 1, but they did allow the ninth-fewest points to passers a year ago. Therefore, Murray is only a borderline starting candidate to open the season.","An efficient rookie effort saw Singletary produce some solid scrimmage outings for the Bills, but the drafting of Zack Moss could mean this smaller back loses out on valuable goal-to-go work. That said, Singletary should see enough work on the ground and as a receiver to help support flex value heading into a division matchup with the Jets.","Cook has stepped up to a new level over the past two seasons, scoring 12-plus fantasy points per game when he'd previously never finished a season averaging more than 9.3 points. He has developed rapport with Drew Brees, and that's a great place to be as a pass-catcher. Look for him to provide decent numbers each week, starting with Week 1 against a lackluster Tampa Bay pass defense.","Is the old Gronk back? It's impossible to know just yet, but there is certainly reason to think that taking a season off from the harsh conditions of the NFL might have the future Hall of Famer feeling as good as ever. He'll have to contend with a couple of incredible receivers for touches, but he has as much chemistry as anyone with Tom Brady. Start him if he's on your roster, as he has the upside for a huge game any given week.","Injuries slowed Brees down a bit last season, but his 2019 points-per-game average was on par with 2018. It's a step down from the dominant player of the early 2010's, but still effective enough to lead a fantasy lineup. The Buccaneers were among the 10 most-favorable QB matchups in fantasy last year, so if you have Brees on your squad, this is definitely a week to start him.","After years of being among the most consistent fantasy forces at the position, an injury-plagued 2019 has Cooks as a borderline flex option heading into his Houston debut. The Chiefs were strong against the pass last season, particularly against receivers, adding some risk to Cooks' profile for the opener.","A steady share of the Bills' passing offense last year helped sustain fantasy relevance for Brown in a strong first season playing with Josh Allen. The presence of Stefon Diggs doesn't help Brown's case for this matchup with the Jets given how limited the passing pie could prove for Buffalo. A lighter workload means Brown is a risky flex option against the Jets. ",null,"Minnesota has become a mainstay among the top D/ST units in recent years and should repeat as one of the primary set-and-forget options for 2020. They combined to score 14 fantasy points across two games with Green Bay last season and will host the Packers to begin the year, so you can expect a solid outing from this unit.","The future is so bright that Jeudy has to wear shades. Dated pop culture references aside, the Alabama product lined up all over the field for Nick Saban's powerhouse and should prove versatile at the next level, as well. It's not clear Jeudy will be a major part of the offense right away given the team's run-first agenda and a bevy of other talented pass-catchers, but a meeting with an exploitable Titans secondary at least helps his prospects as a deep-league option.",null,"A presence on just shy of 40% of his team's offensive snaps through two seasons confirms Michel has been an early-down specialist thus far in his career. Dependent on touchdowns to surface as a valuable fantasy contributor, the presence of goal-line maven Cam Newton doesn't seem very helpful to this end. This first matchup appears inviting, at least, with the Dolphins allowing the third-most rushing yards to backs last season. ","The Rams knew how to force turnovers a year ago, but it's very likely that roster turnover might leave this unit a bit worse off than you may remember from 2019. Los Angeles hosts Dallas in Week 1, but might have taken enough of a step back in terms of personnel to consider this D/ST to be benchable against Dak Prescott and friends."],"2":["While Barkleyâ€™s production was expected to be dampened a bit by running behind a young offensive line, gaining just six yards on 15 carries is obviously excessively low. Luckily, his six catches for 60 yards helped salvage the opener. As most teams do, the Steelers keyed on Barkley throughout Week 1's Monday night affair. Even with a couple of rookie lineman blocking for him, Barkley remains an automatic start with Week 2 offering a less-resistant Bears defense.","A touchdown salvaged an otherwise quiet opener for Hill, but the Chiefs' passing game overall appeared to keep things short and quick, as evidenced by the low air yardage rates for Hill and his peers. This said, a few deep shots for this big-play maven could open up any game, even when facing a solid Chargers secondary.","Carson appeared to be getting eased back into his starting role in Week 1, but he did ultimately lead the Seahawks in RB snaps, while proving he can be an option in both the running and passing games. He might not reach the dominant heights he found at times last season, but he should be a key part of the Seattle offense this season, as demonstrated by his pair of Week 1 receiving scores. That said, against a stalwart New England defense, he's a risky RB2 option in Week 2.","The fact that Murray could come away from a matchup with a very tough San Francisco defense with a more-than-startworthy 26 fantasy points says a lot about the second-year pro. He gets a break this week against Washington, a defense that allowed the seventh-most QB fantasy points in 2019. Lock in Murray as a starter in all formats for this fantastic matchup.","We learned a good bit about this backfield in Week 1; Singletary will play on the majority of snaps and consume more targets than rising rookie Zack Moss, all while Moss consumes more high-value red zone work. With a soft opponent like Miami up next, Singletary's potential for a solid dual-threat outing from scrimmage makes him a solid flex in deeper formats.","There will be weeks when Drew Brees will extend the field but, in the opener, he was content to play the short game. Cook was a prime beneficiary, hauling in five balls for 80 yards, including a 44-yarder -- one of the few times Brees looked downfield. Most weeks, Cook is a back-end TE1 option. Week 2 is no exception as the Saints face a Raiders defense which allowed the 10th-most TE fantasy points last season.","Gronkowski looked spry after taking 2019 off. However, he also appeared rusty. Gronk ended up with just two grabs on three targets, despite playing on 54 snaps. He may eventually return to being Tom Bradyâ€™s safety net, but for now heâ€™s merely one of three experienced Tampa Bay tight ends with the ability to catch the ball. Still, facing a lesser Panthers defense in Week 2 renders Gronkowski playable in leagues with more than a dozen teams.","It was obvious the Saints' focus was on ball control, sticking primarily to short passes. All told, the veteran threw for only 160 yards, though he did connect for a pair of red-zone scores. Week 2 should present more of an opportunity to air it out against the Las Vegas secondary, though Michael Thomas is likely to miss several games. Brees used to be automatic but now heâ€™s no more than a matchup play with Week 2 still looking like a start.","Essentially a decoy in his first game with Houston given a lingering injury, Cooks was just fifth in routes and hauled in only two of five target the loss to the Chiefs. It's not clear if Cooks will handle a full workload just yet, and with a challenging matchup with a solid Ravens pass defense, it's likely best to leave Cooks on the pine for this one.","The arrival of Stefon Diggs didn't crush Brown's opportunity rates, rather, the vet led the team with 10 targets and posted an impressive five first downs in the win over the Jets. While double-digits in targets might not happen often for Brown, there should be adequate bandwidth for him in a nice matchup with Miami.",null,"The Vikings finished Week 1 as the worst D/ST unit in all of fantasy. That's a disappointing start from what should have been a set-and-forget option at the position. They're unlikely to be completely shut out of turnovers and sacks again in Week 2, but the Colts did have a solid showing on offense in Week 1 with 445 total yards. As such, look for other potential options for your Week 2 lineups if Minnesota was your top D/ST choice this year.","Some strong highlights from his debut show that Jeudy can handle the big stage, but he's likely to get increased competition for targets with Courtland Sutton and KJ Hamler nearing a return.",null,"New England rushed the ball by design on 65% of their offensive snaps in Week 1. And yet even in such a run-friendly climate, Michel only mustered 10 touches. Converting a goal-line touch was a positive for Michel, but now he also has Cam Newton to compete with for such valuable, and scarce, opportunities. The Seahawks have ceded the seventh-most fantasy points per game to tailbacks since Week 10 of last year, as Michel enters the matchup as a very risky, touchdown-dependent option.","Offensively, the Eagles stumbled out of the gate. Meanwhile, the Rams held the Cowboys in check in Week 1. Los Angeles did not make many big plays in their season-opener, however, and have to travel across the country to face Philadelphia, so they're a risky D/ST start in Week 2."],"3":["In a crushing blow to the Giants and fantasy teams alike, Barkley tore his right ACL against the Bears and is out for the season.","Hill's 54-yard score late in Week 2's win marked his 18th touchdown of at least 50 yards in his career, tied for the most through a player's first five seasons in NFL history. The big-play maven faces a formidable challenge with the Ravens' capable secondary up next, but Hill's big-play potential keeps him in the must-start tier of receivers.","So far this season, Carson has scored three times in the Seattle passing game. Perhaps more importantly, he took a leap forward as a runner in Week 2  -- up to 72 yards from 21 in Week 1. Going over 100 total yards against the Patriots is a good momentum builder heading into Week 3 against Dallas. Carson is a solid RB2 for this matchup with the Cowboys.","One of the best quarterbacks of the 2020 season gets a matchup with last season's sixth-best defense for opposing passers. This seems like an easy choice. Murray offers so much upside thanks to his running ability (158 yards and three scores through two games) and is easily one of the top overall choices at the QB position in Week 3. Start him with confidence.","It was a nice day from scrimmage for Singletary in Week 2 in that he tallied 76 yards and was productive in both phases. The Rams are allowing the 10th-most fantasy points to tailbacks this year, aiding Singletary's case as a solid flex candidate.","The hope was that Cook would fill some of the void resulting from Michael Thomas' absence. Sadly, the tight end's Week 2 target share dipped a bit from Week 1 as he secured just two of his five looks for 13 yards, albeit one for a red-zone score. With or without Thomas in the lineup, Cook should rebound facing a Packers defense which is softer against tight ends than the Raiders, Cook's Week 2 foe. Consider Cook as a borderline starter for this week's matchup in the Superdome.","Game off! Gronkowski may eventually rekindle the spark he and Tom Brady shared in New England but, for now, the 31-year-old former professional wrestler looks to be long in the tooth.  In Week 2, he was targeted just once, resulting in Brady's third interception of the season. It's time to cut bait on the name brand. Even if the former Patriots teammates get on the same page, the results pale in comparison to their championship days.","Despite finishing with 312 yards and a touchdown, Brees' performance on Monday night appeared to be lackluster, as it was obvious he missed top wideout Michael Thomas. Next up is a Packers defense ranking, um, mid-pack in terms of yards through the air, although they have surrendered four passing touchdowns. With a healthy Thomas, Brees is a low-end QB1. Without him, it's best to find someone with a more favorable matchup.","The absence of Will Fuller V from the game plan for much of the day saw Cooks net an awesome 15.4 air yards per target on his eight looks, aiding his breakout 95-yard showing. The Steelers present a challenging defense for receivers, but with some early struggles from Pittsburgh's secondary thus far, Cooks is a reasonable flex option.","Proving productive even with Stefon Diggs commanding a major share of the offense, Brown averaged an awesome 19.8 air yards per target this past week. Such daring usage helps Brown sustain a rewarding rate of big plays. The Rams have a solid secondary, but Brown's fun opportunity rates are hard to deny.",null,"With only two sacks and a single takeaway over their first two games, the once-mighty Vikings D/ST appears to have taken a step back. A matchup with Tennessee presents an opportunity to bounce back, but with 67 scoreboard points allowed through two games, it might be too big of a risk for most fantasy players in Week 3.","A rib injury limited Jeudy in Week 2, but he's expected to play this week and could command a major share of the offense. The Buccaneers struggled against receivers last season, opening up some potential for Jeudy to thrive amid the injury chaos in Denver's passing game.",null,"Allocated just seven touches and again inefficient with his workload, Michel's touchdown-dependent nature again surfaced in Week 2. The Raiders are allowing the fifth-fewest rushing yards per carry to backs, adding to the fade for Michel.","The Rams D/ST has delivered modest fantasy point returns in the first two games and will face Buffalo in Week 3. The Bills have scored an average of 29 scoreboard points per game this season and are led by a seemingly improved Josh Allen, so it might be best to look elsewhere for your Week 3 D/ST."],"4":[null,"Never truly a target hog like his WR1 fantasy peers, Hill instead proves wildly efficient with a series of big plays. With a touchdown each week thus far, Hill will look to make it four in a row facing the Patriots' proven pass defense.",null,"Murray started off the season looking like a fantasy superstar, but his Week 3 performance is a reminder that this is still just a second-year quarterback. The Oklahoma product finished with three interceptions and his worst rushing performance to date, but managed to maintain a QB1-worthy stat line. The Panthers have been sturdy against passers this season, allowing the third-fewest points to the position so far, but Murray's upside is too high to take him out of your lineup in Week 4.","Working as a key fixture in the Buffalo passing game in Week 3 with Zach Moss out, Singletary delivered an awesome day from scrimmage. The Raiders present an ideal matchup in that they've allowed each opponent to rush for at least 160 yards on the ground and have yielded the most fantasy points to backs this year. Even if Moss is active, Singletary is in a good spot to deliver flex value.","After making a catch in the second half of Sunday night's game, Cook injured his groin and limped off the field. Cook enters Week 4 sas questionable. Only play Cook if he's at full strength -- and even then, consider other options. The Lions have one of the top units in defending the tight end, giving up an average of just three catches for 30 yards per game.","Gronkowski paced Tampa Bay in both targets and catches, engulfing 6-of-7 passes in Week 3, albeit for a tame 48 yards. Gronkowski has yet to display any explosiveness in running after the catch. While he may never recapture the production of his salad days, what is apparent is that he is getting in sync with Tom Brady. Even so, with the limited threat of his breaking off a long play, Gronkowski isn't a fantasy lineup consideration.","Say what you want about Brees' arm strength and his ability to throw downfield, the 41-year-old signal caller can still get it done. Note last Sunday night's 288-yard, 3-TD effort, even as it came in a loss to the Packers. Brees will look to get back to his winning ways against a suspect Lions defense. He won't likely need to put the ball in the air as much against a team with such a weak rush defense, so consider Brees as more of a streaming option in deeper leagues.","Houston spread the ball around to a bevy of targets in Week 3, leaving Cooks with just four targets in an uninspired role. With a healthy Will Fuller, Cooks isn't a very intriguing option even with a nice matchup with Minnesota's soft secondary. ","Brown entered Week 3 with a foot issue and exited the game with a calf injury, limiting him to just 13 out of 36 possible routes. If he's able to suit up for this meeting with the Raiders, Brown faces a Las Vegas defense allowing just the fifth-fewest fantasy points to receivers. This said, his steady vertical role is valuable enough to trust him in lineups if he's active for this matchup.",null,"No D/ST is off to a worse start than Minnesota's, as they've allowed 98 scoreboard points and racked up only three sacks and two takeaways through three weeks. A matchup with Houston won't do them any favors, so keep them on the fantasy waiver wire for Week 4.","Busy out of the slot and lined up in different spots on the field as a weapon for Denver in Week 3, Jeudy seems headed in the right direction as the team's top receiver now that Courtland Sutton is sidelined. The Jets present an inviting matchup for Jeudy given New York has allowed 160 yards per game to receivers, aiding his value as a flex candidate.",null,"The Chiefs have been somewhat porous against the run in allowing 108 yards per game on the ground to backfields. Michel, meanwhile, is coming off of a game full of big runs and his first 100-yard outing since 2018. A boom-or-bust rushing threat, Michel isn't quite worth starting.","The Rams have provided a solid return on investment each week as a D/ST, collecting five turnovers and seven sacks over three games. The Giants are up next, and Daniel Jones and company are certainly turnover-prone, while also lacking the high-end scoring upside that could tank the fantasy score for the Los Angeles D/ST. This is a solid starting option for Week 4."],"5":[null,"Opening the season with four straight games with a touchdown has helped offset any inconsistent yardage outings for Hill so far. A dynamic playmaker facing an exploitable Las Vegas back seven, Hill is a must-start fantasy option for this division matchup.","You wouldn't know Carson was dealing with an injury heading into Week 4, as he led Seattle running backs in snaps while scoring a pair of touchdowns for his best rushing output of the season. He's obviously not 100%, but he's close enough to it that he can still play at an RB1 level for fantasy managers. That makes him a must-start against a subpar Minnesota defense in Week 5.","Murray bailed out an otherwise lackluster outing with three TD passes and 78 rushing yards. Really, that's what we've come to expect from the second-year pro. The passing yards aren't always going to be there for the Arizona signal-caller, but the scoring and rushing are going to come through in the end. He's a solid QB1 against a middling Jets defense.","In an apparent ode to Frank Gore, Singletary grinded out 76 scrimmage yards on 23 touches as the Bills' lead back in Week 4. With Zack Moss likely back in the mix this week, Singletary's touches will take a hit. Countering the loss of work is just how generous Tennessee has been against the run, allowing the most yards per carry to backs. Given the sweet matchup, Singletary is firmly in the flex tier for this conference showdown.","Cook missed last week's game with a sore groin. He'll have an extra day to heal with a Week 5 contest scheduled for Monday night, but the Saints have a bye in Week 6 so they could decide to hold Cook out another week. However, if Cook does play, he's a streaming option against a Chargers team giving up an average of five catches for 56 yards to tight ends.","After looking more like the \"Gronk of old\" in Week 3, Gronkowski just looked old last week, catching one pass, albeit for 29 yards. Gronkowski will need to step up with O.J. Howard now out for the season. Even though Thursday night's foe, the Bears, are allowing an average of 4.8 catches for 42 yards a game to tight ends (with three total touchdowns), Gronkowski is a risky play until he re-establishes his rapport with Tom Brady.","After throwing around two-thirds of his passes within five yards over the first three weeks, Brees aired it out in Week 4 with 56% of his throws traveling at least 10 yards. However, the veteran only put it up 25 times (19 completions) for a total of 246 yards and two passing scores. Despite facing a Chargers defense susceptible to the pass this week, Brees' level of play isn't fantasy-worthy right now given how many quarterbacks are lighting it up.","With just three targets on 34 routes in Week 4, Cooks somehow led the team in routes and didn't secure a single catch. It's been an ugly start to his Houston career, thus maybe a coaching shift can change fortunes. The Jaguars have been solid against the pass, leaving Cooks on the fringe of flex value.","With just 7.4 air yards per target in Week 4, Brown's upside was limited by modest opportunity rates. The Titans have allowed 38 fantasy points per to receiving corps in PPR formats, evidence there is room for Brown to deliver helpful fantasy results in this matchup.","The game between the Patriots and the Broncos has been postponed. Both teams will be on a bye for Week 5.","MVP candidate Russell Wilson and the Seahawks are up next for Minnesota, a defense that has allowed at least 23 scoreboard points in each game so far this season -- and with only three takeaways along the way. There are better D/ST options out there for Week 5.","The game between the Patriots and the Broncos has been postponed. Both teams will be on a bye for Week 5.",null,null,"The Rams had a big day on defense against the Giants, racking up five sacks and allowing only nine scoreboard points. A matchup with Washington in Week 5 should bring more of the same, so if you picked up this squad for Week 4, keep them in the starting spot for the week ahead."],"6":[null,"Penalties cost Hill a few big plays in this one, but a nifty rushing score secured him a touchdown in a fifth straight game to open the season. A playmaking threat dispersed all over the field for the Chiefs, Hill is in a good spot facing a Bills defense that has actually struggled in coverage a bit against receivers this season.",null,"Murray has rushed for at least one touchdown in 4-of-5 starts, with just shy of 300 total rushing yards on the season to go along with his solid passing output. That's why he's one of the top options in fantasy. After all,  a quarterback who can run often outproduces a quarterback who cannot. Against a Dallas defense among the top-10 most generous in allowing QB fantasy points, Murray is  a must-start for Week 6.","It's important to recognize that rookie Zack Moss (when healthy) still looms as a factor in the red zone, capping Singletary's fantasy potential to a degree. This all said, Singletary could have some upside in a game against the Chiefs where Buffalo may well set a season high in snaps. ",null,"Gronkowski had only three catches for 52 yards in Week 5, but one was a 23-yard grab reminiscent of his New England greatness. Gronkowski looks better every week but still isn't a fantasy option for Week 6 as he'll face a Packers defense yielding the seventh-fewest TE fantasy points this season.",null,"From Week 4's catchless showing to this past Sunday's 11-target outing, Cooks' production pattern has been quite unpredictable thus far. It's encouraging either way that he just posted his most yards in a game since 2016. Under a new coaching lens, it's possible Cooks enjoys more steady opportunities. Next up is a matchup with a Titans back seven that has struggled to contain receivers for much of the season. ","He has a strong rapport with Josh Allen, but he was unable to play in Week 5. Still, when healthy, Brown's vertical prowess is a key part of the Buffalo offense. In a game sure to host a healthy projected point total in Vegas, Brown's big-play potential keeps him relevant even amid a tougher matchup with a sound Chiefs pass defense.","Successfully serving the early-down role vacated by an injured Sony Michel in Week 4 with an even 100 yards on the ground, Harris is looking good for a bigger role in Week 5. There was a good deal of positive buzz from the Patriots beat in August about how well Harris played in summer practices, so it's not entirely shocking that the former third-round pick flashed on Monday. Denver has been respectable against the run this season, but Harris' potential to consolidate early-down and goal-to-go rushing work drives flex value in deeper leagues.","They got off to a slow start, but the Vikings are turning things around as a D/ST. With seven sacks and a pair of takeaways over the last two weeks, they'll look to build on that momentum in Week 6. However, they'll face an Atlanta offense that rarely turns the ball over, making them a low-upside play that is probably best left on waivers for this week.","Finally on the field all the time in regards to a full batch of routes in Week 4, Jeudy was targeted just three times in the outing. Either way, Jeudy found the end zone can could see a boost in fantasy stock if Drew Lock is back in the mix. With the Patriots fielding some top coverage talent, it's best to avoid the rookie for this week. ",null,null,"Over the past two weeks, the Rams have been one of the best D/ST performers and they'll face a San Francisco offense in turmoil in Week 6. With 17 sacks over their last three games and plenty of big-play potential, the Rams are a great choice for your starting D/ST spot against the 49ers."],"7":[null,"His scoring streak was snapped in Week 6, as Hill saw just three targets in the win. Denver has a strong defensive reputation, but has actually allowed 38 fantasy points per game to receivers, setting up Hill for a solid showing in this division matchup.","Carson was limited to only eight carries in his last outing, but that was mostly due to game tempo and flow reasons. He still managed six catches on seven targets and salvaged a decent fantasy output, and will now face an Arizona offense allowing around 25 points per game to opposing backs this season. The Seahawks' lead back is a must-start in fantasy and a solid RB2 in all leagues.","Murray was hardly accurate on Monday against the Cowboys, but he still produced a healthy fantasy point total with a trio of touchdowns and 74 rushing yards. It's his fourth time this season going over 60 yards on the ground in a game, and he's scored as a runner six times. That's what makes Murray one of the best -- and safest -- QB options in fantasy. That should remain true against a porous Seattle defense in Week 7.","With the Bills trailing throughout to the Chiefs, Singletary was afforded just 11 touches in a forgettable outing. It's not great that he didn't earn an uptick in receiving work even as his team trailed, but there is some real potential for positive game script this week facing a Jets defense that has allowed the seventh-most fantasy points per game to backfields.","Cook missed Week 4 with a groin issue but returned in Week 5, catching two passes for 52 yards -- including an impressive 41-yard scoring strike. With a week off to completely heal, Cook's volume could increase for Week 7 where he's facing a Panthers defense yielding five TE catches-per-game. Even so, Cook is only in play as a streamer if your primary tight end is off this week.","In Week 6, Gronkowski enjoyed his best game in a Buccaneers uniform, hauling in 5-of-8 targets for a season-high 78 yards and his first scoring strike. Gronkowski benefited from Tom Brady's ball-control approach as the Buccaneers spent the second half protecting a big lead. In this week's road affair with the Raiders, Gronkowski will likely command less of a target share, but the volume should suffice if your plan is to stream tight ends.","After throwing downfield more in Week 5, it will be interesting to see what Brees is able to do following last week's bye, especially if Michael Thomas suits up. Chances are that he'll revert back to the short game as Brees faces a Panthers defense surrendering the second-fewest yards per attempt in the league. Even with Thomas in the Saints huddle, Brees isn't fantasy material this week.","Netting only 6.6 air yards per target last week, Cooks at least thrived in PPR formats with a solid reception rate. There is a solid role emerging for Cooks under a new coaching lens in recent weeks, which helps his case as a flex option for this meeting with a Packers defense that has been solid against the pass.","Unable to connect with Josh Allen in Week 6, Brown will not be playing against the Jets in Week 7 due to a knee injury.","Effective on his few chances as a receiver this past week, the fact Harris was on the field for just a dozen snaps reveals what a small part his plays in this offense. Even with Sony Michel out, facing a tough 49ers front allowing the fewest fantasy points per game to backfields makes it safe to avoid Harris.",null,"Issues with drops surfaced again last week for the rookie. It helps that he averaged 15.2 air yards per target in the win over the Patriots, evidence of a valuable vertical role. Yet without a real rapport yet with Drew Lock, Jeudy isn't a bankable option facing a Chiefs defense allowing the fifth-fewest fantasy points per game to receiving corps. ",null,null,"The Rams couldn't do anything on defense against the 49ers in Week 6, marking a massive disappointment following a solid opening to the season. Chicago is up next. They are an offense near the bottom of the charts in scoring and give the ball away often enough to matter in fantasy. Los Angeles should have a bounce-back week for fantasy purposes and makes for a great D/ST option in Week 7."],"8":[null,"With the Chiefs scoring on special teams and defense in the first half, the team didn't lean on the passing phase much at all in this past week's win over the Broncos. Thankfully, Hill secured the team's lone passing score and led the team in targets by a huge margin. With a steady role and versatile usage, Hill is a solid starting fantasy option for Week 8's matchup with the Jets.","Seattle's RB situation is as tricky as can be at the moment, with their top three options all carrying an injury of some kind into Week 8. Of the trio, Carson's injury appears to be the most serious, and his status for the game is definitely at risk. If he's cleared to go, he's a proven starter in fantasy and can be deployed in all leagues. Just make sure to have a backup plan in place as he works through a foot strain.",null,"Earning his fewest carries of the season against the Jets this past week, Singletary nearly evenly split snaps and touches with rookie Zack Moss. It's not great that Moss enjoyed the far more efficient outing, but it still appears Singletary is the best bet from this backfield for a big day from scrimmage getting to edge against a somewhat slow front seven for New England. With the potential to thrive as a receiver in space, Singletary makes for a low-end flex this week.","Considering the Saints were without their top two wideouts, Cook was quiet last week, catching 3-of-4 targets for 32 yards -- although one was a nifty 4-yard touchdown to open the scoring early in the first quarter. New Orleans will again be shorthanded, though Cook will be challenged by a Bears defense among the best at defending tight ends. Cook is in play as a streamer, but it makes sense to search for an option with a more favorable matchup.","Gronkowski connected with Tom Brady on five passes for 62 yards in Week 7, including finding paydirt for the second consecutive week. While the veteran tight end isn't likely to recapture his glory days, he's established a solid floor after shaking off some initial rust. Gronkowski sits as a low end TE1 for this week's Sunday night date with the Giants.","No Michael Thomas, no Emmanuel Sanders, no problem! In Week 7, Brees connected on 29-of-36 throws for 287 yards and a pair of scoring strikes, leading the Saints to a 27-24 victory over NFC South rival Carolina. Brees will be hard-pressed to emulate last week's effort as, this week, the Saints are on the road to face the tough Bears defense. This isn't the week to use Brees.",null,"Limping throughout Week 6's loss to Kansas City, Brown was ruled out for this past week's win over the Jets with a knee injury, placing his status for this week's tilt with New England in doubt. If he's able to go, Brown makes for a risky fantasy option given any risks of a limited workload and re-injury while facing a difficult matchup against a sound pass defense. ","Harris rumbled for a healthy 5.8 yards per carry this past week, but is still stuck in a limited early-down role in a committeeÂ that rarely proves predicable. The Bills have been average against the run this season, while Harris is likely only going to handle around 10 carries in the outing.","Once a must-have D/ST in fantasy, the Vikings have fallen off quite a bit in 2020 and now lack both the turnover upside and scoreboard point prevention to merit a spot in most fantasy lineups. With Green Bay on the schedule next, you can avoid Minnesota altogether in Week 8.","It's likely not a great sign that even as he led the team's skill players in snaps that Jeudy was seventh on the team in receiving production last week. Most of his looks are down the field, which adds some value to the rookie's profile, but there is a good deal of risk facing a solid Chargers secondary that has allowed the 10th-fewest fantasy points per game to receivers.",null,null,"The Rams blanked the Chicago offense in Week 7, producing double-digit fantasy points for the third time in four weeks. On deck is a matchup with an up-and-down Miami offense that is starting a rookie quarterback. As such, this D/ST is well worth a spot in your lineup for Week 8."],"9":[null,"A game rife with big plays from Hill saw the dynamic playmaker deliver two touchdowns and lead the team in routes run by a wide margin. The clear top vertical playmaker for this offense, Hill is once again a choice fantasy starter even as the Panthers have proven solid in coverage for much of the season.","Carson's fantasy startability for Week 9 depends entirely on his health. With Carlos Hyde dealing with an injury of his own, Carson would likely dominate the touches out of the backfield if cleared to play. Against a middle-of-the-road Buffalo defense, he's a fine RB2 in all formats if healthy, so keep an eye on the news.","Murray is coming off one of the best performances of his young career, racking up four total touchdowns against the rival Seahawks. It was also his fifth game this season with 60-plus rushing yards and he's scored on the ground seven times in eight games. That provides such a high floor that even tough matchups aren't that scary for the Arizona quarterback. Miami has been decent against the pass this season, allowing the ninth-fewest QB fantasy points per game, but that's not reason enough to downgrade Murray out of your starting lineup.","It was a solid day from scrimmage for Singletary against the Patriots, as the young tailback tallied 6.1 yards per touch on his way to 92 total yards. The key element holding him back from really helping fantasy managers is the fact Zack Moss seems to consume and convert high-value goal-line touches at a much higher rate. The Seahawks have allowed just 3.74 yards per carry and the fifth-fewest rushing yards per game to backfields, part of why Singletary is a borderline flex option this week.","Cook's nose for the end zone continued in Week 8 as he chalked up a scoring strike for the third straight game. The score accentuated a solid Week 8 effort wherethe tight end handled 5-of-7 targets for 51 yards. Next on the docket is a trip to Raymond James Stadium for a date with the stout Buccaneers defense. Despite posting a season-high 80 yards in the Week 1 encounter with Tampa Bay, Cooks is a no more than a streaming option for the road rematch.","After failing to score in his first five games wearing a Buccaneers jersey, Gronkowski has now found paydirt in each of the past three games -- the latest being a three-yard scoring strike that helped to fuel Tampa Bay's comeback win over the Giants on Monday night. Gronkowski's involvement shouldn't take much of a hit against the Saints, even if Antonio Brown makes his Buccaneers' debut this week. Look for another solid effort from Gronkowki as New Orleans allows the fifth-most TE fantasy points per game.","Brees overcame windy conditions and an injury-riddled WR corps to engineer a Week 8 overtime win over the Bears at Soldier Field. He completed 31-of-41 throws for 280 yards and a pair of scoring strikes. Week 9 brings a rematch with a Buccaneers defense allowing the third-fewest QB fantasy points per game, relegating Brees to the fantasy bench unless you're in a bye-week pinch.","Even as many of his targets come near the line of scrimmage, Cooks has proven quite busy as a steady underneath option for Deshaun Watson in recent outings. Assuming he consumes a strong share of the passing market in a nice matchup with the Jaguars' suspect back seven, Cooks is a fine flex candidate.","A strong start to the season has given way to a quiet past few weeks defined by injury and quiet box scores. It's admittedly difficult to trust Brown in lineups, but there is some appeal this week if for the matchup alone, with Seattle allowing 57 fantasy points per game to receivers, the most in the league by a significant margin. The risk is quite clear, but the matchup is as good as it gets.","A team-high second 100-yard rushing game of the season this past week confirms Harris has the most potential to help fantasy managers in need of backfield support. This rings especially true this week with a choice matchup with a Jets defense allowing the eighth-most fantasy points per game to backfields.","Even in a big win over the rival Packers, the Vikings failed to make impact plays as a D/ST unit. This is one of the weaker D/ST options in football and should not be on your radar for Week 9.","A team-high 160 air yards and 10 targets in Week 8 suggests some bigger games are on the way for this talented rookie. Jeudy's catch rate with Drew Lock remains quite low, but the Falcons' soft secondary offers real promise for this Alabama product to deliver as a flex option for those facing bye and injury issues.",null,null,null],"11":[null,"Fresh from a career high in targets and a bye week to rest, Hill next faces a Raiders secondary allowing 14 yards per catch to receivers on the season. The Chiefs will pepper Hill with touches in this key rematch of Week 5's outing that saw the Raiders win, supporting legitimate WR1 value for this proven playmaker.","Carson, who has missed the Seahawks' last three contests, begins Week 11 as questionable to return for Thursday's home date with the Cardinals. If he's active, be sure to insert Carson back into your starting lineup before the early kickoff.","Lost in Murray's improbable 43-yard game-winning heave into triple coverage (which was snagged by DeAndre Hopkins) was the two earlier rushing scores, giving the sophomore sensation 10 TD runs in nine games. Next up is one of the worst defenses in the league as Arizona heads to Seattle for Week 11's Thursday night showcase. Lock Murray into your lineup and enjoy the game.",null,"The usually steady Cook was unable to handle his only two looks in the Saints' Week 10 win over the 49ers. With a Week 11 date against the Falcons -- who trot out the most-generous TE fantasy defense -- Cook would typically be a rebound candidate. However, without Drew Brees at the helm, Cook is probably better suited as a bye-week or injury fill-in.","Both of Gronkowski's Week 10 catches were noteworthy from a fantasy standpoint. The second catch was your standard 7-yard grab, but it resulted in a touchdown. His first catch was a 44-yard grab-and-run reminiscent of his salad days  in New England. The veteran tight end is likely to have his involvement impacted some now that Antonio Brown is working out of the slot. Even so, Gronkowski is still a low-end TE1 when the Buccaneers tangle with the Rams in Week 11.","While the overall status of Brees' multiple injuries is unclear, he is currently slated to miss 2-3 weeks, starting with Week 11 against Atlanta.","Conditions in Cleveland this past week didn't really allow for much passing success, leaving Cooks with just 39 yards despite tying for the team lead in targets. Expected to see a higher average depth of target this week against his former team, Cooks makes for a reasonable flex option even with the Patriots proving solid against the pass.",null,"Another big game on the ground for Harris means he's the third Patriots back ever with at least three 100-yard outings within his first six career starts. While he won't help at all in the receiving department, Harris still has a fun fantasy profile this week given the Texans have allowed 5.53 yards per carry to backs this season, most in the NFL.","The Vikings continue to sport one of the weakest defenses in the league as they're allowing the third-highest average scrimmage yards per game in the NFL. Andy Dalton's return to the Dallas huddle should be enough to keep the Vikings D/ST on the fantasy sidelines when Minnesota and the Cowboys square off in Week 11.","Averaging a robust 17.1 air yards per target this past Sunday, Jeudy's 17 yards per reception was fueled by such strong opportunity rates. With the Dolphins allowing roughly 38 fantasy points per game to receivers on the year, Jeudy is in a position to post flex-worthy results in PPR formats.",null,null,"The stellar Rams defense ranks second in terms of fewest scrimmage yards allowed per game. They are also second in sacks per game and 12th in turnovers. They'll be put to the test on Monday night, drawing a Tom Brady who is fresh off a 341-yard, 3-TD effort against Carolina. Even so, Brady has put up a few clunkers this season, so don't think twice about keeping the Rams D/ST active for Week 11."],"12":[null,"Prior to Week 10, Hill hadn't yet topped the 100-yard mark in a contest this season, but has delivered consecutive triple-digit showings, including a stellar 11-catch performance against the Raiders this past Sunday evening. This proven playmaker is a fantasy fixture heading into a meeting with Tampa Bay.","Carson is expected to return to the Seattle lineup in Week 12 -- a welcome sight for those who have held onto the back during his injury absence. He would immediately vault back into must-start territory after having posted double-digit points in every healthy outing in 2020. Keep an eye on the injury report and move Carson back into your lineup if he's slated to play against the Eagles.","Murray played through a minor shoulder injury in Week 11, yet still delivered a starter-worthy fantasy performance, even if it was one of his worst of the season. Assuming he's cleared to play for Week 12, there's no reason to consider moving him out of your lineup for a matchup with the capable (but not spectacular) New England defense.","The Bills' ground game simply couldn't get untracked against the Cardinals back in Week 10, leaving Singletary with his lowest fantasy output of the entire season. With Zack Moss positioned as the favored goal-line option from the Buffalo backfield, even this friendly matchup with Los Angeles doesn't help him break into the flex tier.","Cook grabbed his only target in Week 11 for a six-yard gain. The catch was one more than he registered in Week 10. It's clear that he's become an afterthought in the New Orleans offense.","In Week 11, Gronkowksi posted his second dud in three weeks, catching just two balls for 25 yards in Monday night's loss to the Rams. With a healthy receiving corps that now includes Antonio Brown, Gronkowski's target share in Tampa Bay has suffered. The fact that he's still a TE1 in Week 12, despite facing a Chiefs defense allowing the 11th-fewest TE fantasy points per game, is a reflection of how weak the position is this season.",null,"Posting just over 21 yards per haul this past week against his former team, Cooks has been far more productive since the team's coaching shift several weeks ago. Up next for this solid WR3 option is a meeting with a Lions defense ceding nearly 39 fantasy points per game to receiving corps.","An ankle injury suffered in Week 10 limited Brown to 14 fewer routes than Stefon Diggs, but it was still impressive that this speedster turned in his second straight strong yardage performance. It's worth monitoring Brown's injury status as this matchup with a strong Chargers' secondary approaches, but he's a worthy flex if active for this AFC showdown.","Consistent goal-line usage could be the key to Harris' success as a fantasy option in the weeks ahead -- especially with Rex Burkhead sidelined. The Cardinals have been respectable against backfields in allowing only 22 fantasy points per game, suggesting Harris will need to find the end zone to really fantasy managers.","The Minnesota defense has been playing better of late, forcing seven turnovers since their Week 7 bye after managing only five over the first six games of the season. However, this team also allowed Dallas to post 31 scoreboard points against them last week and has only six sacks in its past four outings. It's a mixed bag, so you should probably look elsewhere for your Week 12 D/ST.","The opportunity rates remain impressive for this rookie; he's earned at least eight targets in four straight games and has led the team in air yardage during this stretch. Even with this nice target share, an inefficient young quarterback and this difficult matchup serve to limit this Alabama product's fantasy value in Week 12. There is a high ceiling for this dynamic rookie, but the Saints' respectable defense and Drew Lock's issues in the pocket serve to keep Jeudy just on the edge of flex consideration.

That's especially true against a banged-up San Francisco offense in Week 12."],"13":[null,"Hill now has 13 touchdowns where he's been clocked at 20 MPH since 2018, six more than the next closest player. Sticking with the number 13, Hill set a career high in receptions with as many hauls in last week's career outing that saw him produce the most PPR points in a game as a skill player since Jamaal Charles back in 2013. Even as the Broncos have been respectable in coverage this season, Hill is a game-breaking force worthy of must-start status.","Carson returned to action in Week 12 against the Eagles and handled 10 touches, scoring a touchdown while racking up almost 60 total yards. He's not back to 100% and the plan for Seattle will likely be for him to split time with Carlos Hyde moving forward, so he's not immediately back to RB1 status. Still, given his efficiency and chemistry with Russell Wilson, he should be considered a starter in most leagues against a porous Giants run defense.","Murray's MVP candidacy might have taken a hit in Week 12, but his starting status in fantasy did not. Yes, he struggled against the Patriots and faces a tough Los Angeles defense in Week 13, but this is no time to give up on the second-year pro. He posted big numbers in Weeks 1-2 against decent pass defenses (San Francisco, Washington) and there's every reason to think he can bounce back in Week 13 -- even against the Rams. Keep the faith!","Tallying one of his better scrimmage showings of the season, Singletary was far more efficient as a rusher than backfield peer Zack Moss. With big-play upside when given the ball in space, Singletary is a borderline flex candidate heading into a challenging matchup with the 49ers.","Cook's involvement with the Saints passing game is already limited, but with Taysom Hill only needing to throw 16 times in Week 12, the tight end saw just two targets without a reception. Hill will have to air it out more in Week 13 against Atlanta, but Cook still doesn't merit fantasy attention.",null,null,"An efficient Week 12 saw Cooks turn in another strong line. This week, even as the Colts present a tough matchup, Cooks is due for a huge workload given the release of Kenny Stills and the suspension of Will Fuller V. With a real shot at double-digit targets, Cooks could really cook this week.",null,"Harris and James White combined to share touches and snaps out of the backfield in a two-man committee for the New England offense this past weekend. Harris wasn't efficient, but he did lead the backfield with 14 touches and presents as a touchdown-dependent option against a porous Chargers' rush defense.","The Minnesota D/ST is trending in the right direction, but not quite enough to merit a spot in your fantasy lineup. With only a single sack in its last two outings and just two takeaways over that span, not even decent points-allowed performances will give this team starter-worthy upside. A matchup with Jacksonville is appealing, but consider this unit only as a last-ditch option.","It's best to consider Week 12's ugly outing as a no-show for Jeudy and Denver's other key pass-catchers. Often near the lead for the Broncos in both routes run and targets each week, Jeudy enters Arrowhead with some upside given what could be a pass-happy agenda for Denver.",null,"In his return to action after missing nearly two months of action, Michel played a single offensive snap in Week 12 and ended up blocking on that down. With New England relying on Damien Harris and James White, there's no fantasy appeal for Michel against Los Angeles this week. ","The Rams have a top-five D/ST which should be started every week. That's true even against a high-upside offense like the one from Arizona -- especially with the Cardinals slowing down a bit over recent weeks and the Rams racking up eight takeaways and nine sacks in its past three games."],"14":[null,"Had the Chiefs challenged a fairly incredible catch from Hill on a weird play this past Sunday, his fantasy line would have included a touchdown. A bad drop also limited Hill's ceiling in the contest, but with such awesome vertical work each week and a matchup against an average Miami back seven, he's firmly in the WR1 discussion this week.","Carson was the clear leader in playing time out of the backfield for Seattle in Week 13 and, while he didn't post great numbers as a rusher, his three receptions netted him 45 yards and a touchdown. That gives him a score in six out of his eight appearances this season. It's a trend that bodes well for him finding the end zone against the Jets this week. Trust him as a solid RB1 in all formats as he gets such an easy matchup.","In Week 13 against the Rams, Murray finished with fewer than 200 yards passing for the fourth time this season. On the plus side, though, he did manage to throw a trio of passing touchdowns. The more concerning trend for Murray is his drop in rushing volume, with only 15 carries for 61 yards over the past three games. The second-year pro has fallen from his MVP-candidate pace and is now more of a low-end QB1 in fantasy, especially against a solid Giants' pass defense that kept Russell Wilson at bay last week.","This second-year playmaker took advantage of increased opportunities to collect 21 touches, as backfield peer Zack Moss finished with just four touches likely due to an early fumble in Week 13. The Steelers have allowed the second-fewest fantasy points to backs on the year, limiting Singletary's fantasy prospects.","Cook had just one catch on five targets over his previous three games, but he matched that target total in Week 13, catching three balls -- including a score -- in the Saints' victory in Atlanta. Next on the slate is a favorable matchup against an Eagles defense surrendering the seventh-most TE fantasy points per game. Cook's production is usually too low for fantasy consideration, but the soft matchup renders him as a streaming candidate.","While his 31-year-old body probably appreciated the Buccaneers' Week 13 bye, Gronkowski is likely pining to get back on the field after clearing 100 yards receiving for the first time with Tampa Bay in Week 12. The Buccaneers are back in action this week with a home tilt against the Vikings. Gronkowski is more inconsistent than in his salad days, but he still belongs in a fantasy lineup in Week 14.",null,"With at least 65 yards in three-straight games and at least five targets in eight straight, Cooks has become a relatively high-floor option for those in PPR formats. The Bears has been relatively stingy for much of the season against wideouts, though, curbing Cooks' value to the flex tier.",null,"Netting 5.6 yards per touch and pacing the team from scrimmage in Week 13 is a solid sign for Harris' continued value -- particularly in non-PPR leagues. The ceiling is somewhat low, however, for a player with little usage in the passing phase, especially as the Rams have allowed the sixth-fewest fantasy points to backfields on the year.","The Vikings D/ST was able to rack up the takeaways against Mike Glennon and the Jaguars in Week 13 and has limited their opponents to no more than 20 scoreboard points in four of their last five outings. However, a matchup with the capable Tampa Bay offense is up next, which is just too risky for such a boom-or-bust unit.","A knee injury and lack of chemistry with his quarterback saw Jeudy secure just one of his four looks this past week in Kansas City. The Panthers are up next for this gifted rookie and have proven capable against receivers for much of the season, signaling the floor remains pretty low for the Alabama product.",null,"Mixed into the game plan a bit more thanks to the team building a massive lead, it's unlikely that Michel helps fantasy teams this week in a much more challenging matchup with one of the league's top defenses.","One of the best D/ST units in football will match up against one of the lowest-upside offenses in Week 14 when the Rams host the Patriots. This is yet another great opportunity to rely on the elite Rams D/ST."],"15":[null,"Even in a week that saw him haul in just three of his seven targets, Hill still found a way to deliver two scores and is now up to 16 scores on the season, with only Randy Moss and Jerry Rice having produced more touchdowns at the position through 13 games in the Super Bowl era. The Saints claim a solid pass defense, but Hill's unique scoring upside makes him a surefire starter in all formats.","Carson wasn't called upon often as the Seahawks demolished the Jets in Week 14 and, unfortunately, it was likely his last favorable matchup of the season. His final three opponents all boast top run defenses, starting with this week's opponent, Washington. However, a tougher contest could actually mean that Carson becomes more heavily involved in the Seahawks offense -- and it's his volume that drives his fantasy value. Keep him in your lineup as a RB2, even against the elite Washington run-stoppers.","Many fantasy managers who trusted in Murray this season found themselves out of the playoff hunt given his recent struggles, but most of that can be chalked up to matchups. Games against the Patriots, Rams and Giants are among the toughest for quarterbacks in fantasy -- and things don't get any easier in Week 15 and beyond. A matchup with the Eagles is the \"easiest\" left on the slate for Murray. If you made it this far with him, you definitely need to keep him in your lineup. Silver lining? Murray did run the ball 13 times in Week 14 -- a big jump from his 5.0 carries per game over the previous three contests.","Deep into the season we find Buffalo with the second pass-heaviest offense in the league. Last week's surge in opportunities for Singletary proved short-lived, as rookie Zack Moss resurfaced this week to lead the team in touches. While the Broncos have allowed nearly 100 rushing yards per game to backs, the early-down work figures to be split nearly evenly and neither Buffalo back has been used at a high rate in the passing game, leaving Singletary outside of flex territory for this week.","In Week 14, Cook found the end zone for the second consecutive game, reeling in a 20-yard toss on one of his three receptions. New Orleans will look to rebound from their surprising loss to Philadelphia when they entertain the 11-1 Chiefs in a Week 15 clash of first-place clubs. Kansas City has allowed the seventh-most TE fantasy points per game, leaving Cook as a streaming option in deeper formats.","Gronkowski only caught one of his two Week 14 targets, but it resulted in his patented spike, as the big tight end secured a 2-yard TD reception. Next up is a Falcons defense yielding the fifth-most TE fantasy points per game, keeping Gronkowski as a low-end TE1 for Week 15.","Brees is questionable to return for the Saints' Week 15 home tussle with the Chiefs. Even if he plays, there is the chance he will split time with Taysom Hill, removing him from any fantasy thought.","A combination of foot and neck injuries sidelined this veteran wideout last week. If he's able to return to action this week, Cooks makes for a viable flex play given he just tallied a respectable showing against the Colts in Week 13 and should consume a healthy share of the passing game.",null,"An early-down option who loses meaningful goal line work to Cam Newton and is sharing more touches with Sony Michel each week, Harris is tough to trust in lineups this week against the rival Dolphins.","The last time the Vikings faced the Bears, Minnesota limited Chicago to just 13 scoreboard points and forced a pair of turnovers. However, Chicago is on the rise of late, and Minnesota has been inconsistent on defense this season. There's a bit of upside here, but consider this D/ST only as a last resort.","Unable to get in on the big-play fun this past Sunday against the Panthers, Jeudy produced another quiet line with just two catches. The Bills present a challenge for the rookie given a capable secondary, leaving this Alabama product outside of starting territory in fantasy terms.",null,"Limited to just a handful of rushes each week as the change-of-pace option behind Damien Harris, you can safely ignore Michel in all formats ahead of this meeting with the Dolphins.","Since the Week 9 bye, Los Angeles has been among the best defenses in football. With 11 takeaways, three D/ST touchdowns and 17 sacks over five games, this is an elite, must-start fantasy option -- and that's before you factor in a prime matchup with a stumbling Jets offense."],"16":[null,"Another week and another touchdown for this proven playmaker, who has scored in all but one game since Week 7 and is a weekly threat for multiple game-changing plays. The Falcons have allowed 43.8 fantasy points per game to receivers this season, second most in the entire NFL. This should be fun.","The Seahawks have a trio of very tough defensive matchups to end the season -- and fantasy managers felt that in Week 15 as Seattle struggled to post big numbers against Washington. Things get worse in Week 16 against a top Rams defense, but Carson is still a high-volume back who should see touches in the red zone. He's a viable RB2/flex in all leagues.","After three straight weeks facing teams among the top 10 in preventing QB fantasy points, Murray was given a golden rebound opportunity against the Eagles and took full advantage. He had one of his most prolific days as a passer ever and chipped in with a rushing touchdown to truly give his fantasy point total a boost. Unfortunately, he's back to facing a top-10 pass defense in Week 16 with a game against San Francisco. As such, Murray is more of a low-end starter rather than one with 35- or 40-point upside like he showed last week.","A touchdown in the final minutes of a blowout win helped bolster an otherwise quiet day from Singletary in Week 15, as he was fairly pedestrian save for the late 51-yard score. With Zack Moss earning more touches during the contest, it's risky to trust Singletary in lineups even as the Patriots have struggled against backfields. ","Cook brought in 2-of-5 targets for 29 yards in Week 15, but he failed to find paydirt after two straight weeks of latching onto a scoring strike. Cook's weekly catch and yardage totals alone don't warrant a fantasy spot, and counting on those touchdowns is too risky. It's best to look elsewhere for a Week 16 tight end, especially since the Saints host the Vikings and the league's 12th-stingiest defense against the position.","Gronkowski managed to handle just 3-of-7 targets (though many were throw-aways) on the way to a modest 29 receiving yards in the Buccaneers' thrilling takedown of the Falcons in Week 15. Next up is a Saturday date in Detroit, facing a Lions defense yielding the eighth-fewest TE fantasy points per game. Even with the tough matchup, Gronkowski's floor and his nose for the end zone land him in low-end TE1 territory.","After missing four games, Brees was back under center in New Orleans' Week 15 home loss to Kansas City. The veteran shook off some early rust to record 234 yards through the air, with three passing scores. The Saints entertain the Vikings in Week 16's Friday matinee. Minnesota's defense has yielded the 12th-fewest QB fantasy points, leaving Brees out of the fantasy picture.","A return from a neck injury saw Cooks pace the team in routes and finish second in receptions in a loss to the Colts this past week. The touchdowns went to his peers, however, as Cooks hasn't scored since Week 9 and has just three scores on the season. The matchup gets better this week with the Bengals allowing nearly 13 yards per catch to receivers, helping Cooks' case as a low-end flex.","Close to a return to action this past week, Brown could reclaim his busy role on the outside of the Bills' offense this week. If that's the case, there is some inherent risk in trusting a player back from an extended injury absence, but there is some fantasy appeal to playing the big-play vertical role in a Josh Allen offense. It's worth noting the Patriots held Brown to just one catch back in Week 8.","An ankle injury kept Harris out of last week's matchup with Miami, which proved unfortunate given he had scored in three of the prior four games. If he's back in the mix this week, Harris could help those in non-PPR formats given Buffalo ranks 21st against the run this season. ","Drew Brees might not be back to 100%, but he's still more than capable of leading the Saints to a productive day on offense against the lackluster Minnesota defense. There are far better D/ST options than a unit which has just three sacks over its last four outings.","Only able to secure on of five targets this past Saturday, Jeudy just hasn't been able to get on the same page with Drew Lock given he's only hauled in 30.8% of his targets the past three weeks. Without a stable floor or a very high ceiling in place, this tough matchup with a capable pass defense removes any fantasy appeal for Jeudy.",null,"With Damien Harris ailing this past week, Michel impressed with 74 yards on 10 carries. The holdup in getting excited includes the potential return of Harris and how Cam Newton is a weekly threat to consume high-leverage goal-line touches. With a low floor, it's best to avoid Michel against the Bills.","The Rams had a surprisingly poor showing against the Jets in Week 16, failing to secure any takeaways from one of the league's worst offenses. The Seahawks turned the ball over three times the last time they played the Rams, so if you believe the Jets game was an outlier, Los Angeles makes for a fine rebound candidate D/ST in Week 16."],"17":[null,"Hill battled through a hamstring injury to produce 16.3 yards per catch in a key win over the Falcons this past week, but it appears the team will rest its key playmakers to some degree this week, suggesting Hill isn't worth trusting in lineups against the Chargers.","Carson led the Seattle backfield in touches in Week 16 against a tough Rams defense. While he didn't produce incredible numbers, he did enough to get by for some fantasy mangers. Expect more of the same in Week 17 against a tough San Francisco defense, meaning Carson is a RB2/flex play in most leagues due to his limited upside in a tough matchup.","It's not easy to say this, but Murray is dealing with a lower leg injury and facing one of the best defenses in football in Week 17. If you've made it this far with the Arizona quarterback, you might need to find a better option for the final week. If he's out, you'll obviously have to look elsewhere, but you may want to do so even if he does play. The Rams allow the fewest overall QB fantasy points.","Sharing work nearly evenly with Zack Moss in this past Monday's drubbing of the Patriots embodies how this Bills' backfield has unfolded all season. With Moss earning more high-value touches around the goal line, it's best to avoid Singletary in lineups for this tilt with the Dolphins.","Cook's 44-yard grab helped fuel his most prolific game of the season as he finished Week 16 with three catches for 82 yards. Next on the docket for the Saints is the season finale in Carolina, with a chance to clinch the NFC's best record and a first-round bye. However, Cook's production is too inconsistent to merit fantasy consideration.","Gronkowski was only targeted twice in Week 16, but the results speak for themselves. The veteran reeled in a 33-yard scoring strike from Tom Brady and a 25-yard TD connection from Blaine Gabbert. Gronkowski isn't getting the volume he once did, but he's made the most of things with seven 2020 touchdowns. Week 17 presents a Falcons defense surrendering the second-most TE fantasy points per game, keeping Gronkowski in play as a streaming option.","After completing just 44% of his passes in Week 15 (coming off a four-game absence), Brees connected on 73% of his attempts in Week 16, going 19-of-26 for 311 yards. With New Orleans scoring seven rushing touchdowns, Brees didn't need to throw any scoring strikes. Week 17 brings a trip to Carolina and a chance to earn the NFC's bye, but you may want to try and find a more fantasy reliable option than Brees.","Turning his second-best yardage performance of the season deep into the fantasy playoffs against the Bengals this past week, Cooks has tallied at least five catches in five of his past six appearances and was able to deliver a touchdown in his first meeting with the Titans. Given his recent success as the team's top target, Cooks makes for a sound starting option this week.",null,"Missing the past several weeks with an injury means fantasy managers can't trust Harris even if he returns this week against the Jets given the team's propensity to split work among several backfield members.","With injuries to deal with and five giveaways over the past two games, the Lions are definitely stumbling to the 2020 finish line. However, the Vikings might not be the team to capitalize as a D/ST, as they rank in the bottom 10 in sacks and are rather mediocre at takeaways. Consider this unit only as a last resort.","Sometimes it's great to tie the feat of a very productive receiver such as Brandon Marshall, but in the case of Jeudy, he just became the first Broncos player with four drops in a game since Marshall in 2007. Then again, Jeudy has four drops total in all of his other games this season, but the overall lack of efficiency with a struggling Drew Lock limits the fantasy appeal this week against the Raiders.",null,"Earning early-down duties with Damien Harris still ailing, Michel was efficient as a rusher but limited in workload. This tends to be the way the team has used Michel this season, thus he's not a worthy fantasy play this week against the Jets.","The Rams were back to peak performance in Week 16 after previously stumbling against the Jets, racking up five sacks and holding Seattle to just 20 scoreboard points. A matchup with Arizona's low-upside offense in a must-win game is a great spot to trust this top fantasy D/ST in the last week of the season."],"10":[null,null,"Carson's status for Week 10 looks optimistic, as he's expected to return to the practice field to test out his injured foot. Should he return, he's a must-start given his fantasy-friendly role in one of the best offenses in football. Just keep an eye out for his status and lock him in as an RB2 in all formats if he's cleared to play.","Murray has racked up four total touchdowns in back-to-back games and will look to keep that streak going against a Buffalo defense that ranks near the middle of the pack in stopping opposing quarterbacks in fantasy. The Arizona signal-caller might be the best overall player at any position in Week 10 with his unique combination of elite running and productive passing, so don't even think about moving him out of your lineup.","With Zack Moss established as the team's primary goal-line threat, Singletary won't help fantasy rosters save for the rogue big receiving effort. Next facing an Arizona defense that has allowed the third-most yards per catch to tailbacks, Singletary is likely just outside of flex range this week.","Heading into Week 9, Cook had caught touchdowns in three straight and four of five games. Brees found his tight ends for two scores in the Saints 38-3 whitewashing of the Buccaneers but Cook failed to find the end zone on either of his two catches. Expecting a touchdown Week 10 against the 49ers may be risky since San Francisco has administered just two scores to tight ends all season, but Cook is still a low end TE1.","After scoring in three straight games, reestablishing himself as a top fantasy performer, Gronkowki was nearly invisible in Sunday night's 38-3 trouncing by New Orleans. The veteran reeled in just one of six looks, netting a paltry two yards. Chalk up Week 9 as one to forget, with Gronkowski remaining a solid tight end option when Tampa Bay looks to rebound against Carolina in their Week 10 showdown.","Brees had his way with the Tampa Bay defense, as 12 Saints receivers made the Week 9 box score with at least one reception. All told, Brees connected on 26 of 32 tosses for 222 yards and four scores. Next on the docket is a home date with San Francisco and their depleted but still competitive defense, slotting Brees as a streaming candidate.","A huge touchdown haul helped Cooks deliver for fantasy managers in Week 9 despite hauling in just a third of his targets. Unlike previous weeks that saw Cooks peppered with targets around the line of scrimmage, he actually led the team in air yardage this past week with a healthy 14.3 yards per target. Proving much more valuable as a fantasy contributor since the team's coaching change, Cooks makes for a solid flex or WR3 for this matchup against a Browns secondary allowing the fifth-most fantasy points per game to receivers.","A revival performance in Week 9 featured Brown earning double-digit targets for the first time since the opener. The veteran field-stretcher produced four first downs and nearly secured a touchdown in the rousing win over the Seahawks. Next facing his former team's mediocre pass defense, Brown makes for a strong streaming option given this recent surge in attention.","A big hit saw Harris leave Week 9's tilt with the Jets with what the team deemed a chest injury, but not before compiling 71 rushing yards on 14 totes. Without any real usage as a receiver and paired with arguably the best goal-line rushing threat in the league in Cam Newton, it's safe to deem Harris a risky flex play ideal for standard leagues against the Ravens' sound rush defense.","The offense may be on the rise for Minnesota, but the D/ST is still below average. While they did intercept three passes against the Lions, that's an exception to the rule this season in terms of takeaways, and the Vikings allow plenty of scoreboard points and lack in pass-rushing upside. Even against a roller-coaster Chicago offense, the Minnesota D/ST isn't quite on the starting level in Week 10.","Patience is finally being rewarded for investors in Jeudy, as the ultra-talented rookie is fresh from his best professional outing and now has at least 10 targets in consecutive outings. An awesome juke on a comeback route earned Jeudy his second career touchdown in Week 9, a total he's looking to build on against a Raiders defense that has allowed the fifth-most yards per reception to wideouts this season.",null,null,"The Rams have delivered some huge D/ST performances this season, going into double-digits in fantasy points three times in eight games. But a matchup with the incredible Seattle offense is on deck, which is tough for even the best of defenses. Coming off of their bye week, the Rams' D/ST might be on your waiver wire, but there are likely better Week 10 options than a team facing the second-best scoring offense in

2019 season fell short of lofty expectations, but the 2018 second-overall pick finished strongly and remains an elite fantasy asset. Barkley, who missed three games because of injury, was on the field for 84% of New York's snaps -- about the same as his rookie season (83%) -- when active. His 16.7 carries per game were up slightly from 2018 (16.3), though his targets inexplicably fell from 7.4 to 5.5 per game. Barkley still managed the third-most fantasy points among RBs during his 12 full weeks. We shouldn't count on a big rebound in targets with Jason Garrett running the offense, but Barkley does figure to see more run at the goal line (only seven carries inside the 5 last season). Only Christian McCaffrey is a clear superior fantasy asset to 23-year-old Barkley.","Hill heads into his fifth NFL season having never finished lower than fourth among WRs in fantasy points per snap. Last season, the speedster missed four games because of injury and saw a slight dip in usage. Still, he remained a dominant fantasy force when active, posting a top-10 week during one-third of his outings (the league's fifth-highest rate). Hill has scored 36 touchdowns in 59 regular-season games and trails only Travis Kelce in target priority on Andy Reid's high-scoring, pass-heavy Chiefs offense led by Patrick Mahomes. Hill is a solid WR1 with added value in non-PPR formats.","Carson put together another solid season as Seattle's lead back in 2019 and returns atop the depth chart for 2020. The 2017 seventh-round pick has missed a total of three games over the past two seasons but finished fifth in rushing yards during both campaigns. Carson has been of value near the goal line (18 touchdowns) and in terms of efficiency (2.26 YAC is fourth best) during that span. Seattle ramped up Carson's passing-game workload last season, which gives him a better shot at his third-consecutive top-15 fantasy campaign, but the 25-year-old will need to fend off Rashaad Penny and rookie DeeJay Dallas for snaps. Consider Carson a fine RB2 target.","Murray's rookie season had its ups and downs, which is exactly what you'd expect from a first-year starting quarterback. The 2019 first overall pick struggled to 6.9 YPA and took a league-high 48 sacks, but he also finished strong by leading the Arizona offense to three-plus touchdowns in eight of the team's final 11 games. Murray's rushing ability helped him to a 93-544-4 rushing line (top-four in all three categories) and an eighth-place finish in fantasy points. Murray was already a strong bet for a second-year leap, but the addition of DeAndre Hopkins further adds to his appeal. The hype might lead to an irresponsible ADP, but there's little doubt Murray has elite upside. He's a solid fantasy starter.","An injury may have limited Singletary's early-season contributions during his rookie campaign, but the 2019 third-round pick quickly overtook Frank Gore upon his return. During Weeks 8-16, Singletary handled a generous 14.9 carries and 4.0 targets per game. He was held to three touchdowns but was ninth among RBs in scrimmage yards, while playing 74% of the snaps during that span. Though he struggled after contact, Singletary's 5.1 YPC was sixth best among backs. Singletary is expected to work as the lead back again this season, but his 5-foot-7, 203-pound frame will limit his volume. Expect rookie Zack Moss to be heavily involved, along with Josh Allen, at the goal line. Singletary may struggle to clear a half-dozen touchdowns but will get enough work to flirt with top-20 production.","After failing to post a single fantasy campaign better than 12th during his first eight NFL seasons, Cook has posted a pair of top-seven finishes (and with different teams) over the past two seasons. Cook missed a pair of games last season, but managed a TE7 campaign thanks to nine touchdowns (his 11 end zone targets tied for most among tight ends and eighth in the league) and elite efficiency (he posted the position's highest aDOT, YPR and YPT). Cook is now 33 years old, but his role as one of Drew Brees' primary targets remains secure. Consider him a borderline top-10 fantasy option.","Gronk is back! The longtime Patriots' superstar ended his retirement and was traded to the Buccaneers, where he'll reunite with his former quarterback Tom Brady. Gronkowski sat out last season after ending 2018 with his seventh fantasy finish of 11th or better in nine NFL seasons. When healthy, effectiveness has never been an issue for Gronkowski (he has never played a season in which he was lower than seventh among tight ends in yards per target or yards per reception), but durability has been an issue (he hasn't appeared in a full 16-game regular season since 2011).'Gronkowski is unlikely to re-emerge as an elite fantasy option, but he's in a good enough situation to allow mid-to-back-end TE1 numbers.","Brees missed six games due to injury last season and also ceded occasional snaps to Taysom Hill. The future Hall of Famer was still fantasy's No. 2 scoring QB during the 10 weeks he was active, producing 28 touchdowns and only three interceptions. Brees continues to win with elite efficiency, having paced the NFL in completion percentage in each of the past three seasons while ranking no lower than 10th in YPA during that span. Brees' supporting cast is arguably better this season, with Emmanuel Sanders added to a group that includes Michael Thomas, Jared Cook, Alvin Kamara and a quality line. Now 41, Brees is a back-end QB1.","Cooks was traded to the Texans during the offseason and will compete for targets with Will Fuller V, Randall Cobb and Kenny Stills. At 26, Cooks is still in his prime, but has already been traded three times. Despite the constant movement, he has finished four of the past five seasons as a top-15 fantasy WR. Primarily a vertical threat, Cooks ranked no lower than ninth in YPT in the three seasons prior to an injury-plagued 2019 campaign with the Rams. Concussions are an ongoing concern for Cooks, but, if healthy, he's in good shape as one of Deshaun Watson's top targets. He should be on your flex radar, though there's certainly WR2 upside to be found here.","Brown's first season with the Bills was a giant success, as the vertical threat set career-best marks in targets (116), receptions (72) and receiving yards (1,060). Brown handled a generous 26% target share during 15 regular-season games and finished 20th at wide receiver in fantasy points. Despite the strong output, Brown's fantasy stock has taken a hit due to Buffalo's trade for Stefon Diggs. With an expectation for reduced target share, a vertical role that limits consistency and receptions, and a run-heavy scheme, it's hard to view Brown as a safe weekly starter. The 30-year-old is a fringe flex option.","Harris enters his second NFL season as part of a crowded New England backfield that includes Sony Michel, James White, Rex Burkhead and Brandon Bolden. A third-round pick last offseason, Harris was limited to five snaps during his rookie campaign. He lacks top-end speed (4.57 40-yard dash) but has decent size (5-foot-10, 216 pounds) and is a powerful, downhill runner with exceptional ball security (zero fumbles in 2018). He's also a good pass-catcher and blocker, which supplies him with three-down upside in the pros. Harris is buried in New England, but one injury could vault him into a big role. He's an end-of-bench stash at best.","The Minnesota D/ST posted its second consecutive fifth-place fantasy campaign last season and has now finished no lower than 11th over the past five seasons. Minnesota has finished top seven in points allowed each of the past five seasons, top five in sacks each of the past two seasons and was top five in both interceptions and forced fumbles in 2019. Despite the success, it's fair to expect a step back in 2020 following the departures of Everson Griffen, Linval Joseph and literally all three of the team's top three corners from 2019. The addition of Michael Pierce helps, and star power remains in the form of Danielle Hunter, Eric Kendricks, Harrison Smith and Anthony Harris, but unproven cornerbacks and overall depth are major red flags. Consider the Minnesota D/ST a borderline fantasy starter.","Denver selected Jeudy with the 15th pick of April's draft. The Alabama product sports a 6-foot-1, 193-pound frame and is extremely versatile, having shown the ability to produce on all levels, as well as in the slot (69% in 2019) and on the perimeter. Jeudy is fast (4.45 40-yard dash), agile and a quality route-runner. Jeudy slots in behind Courtland Sutton but has little competition for snaps otherwise and should be an every-down player out of the gate. Jeudy has WR1 upside down the road but should be viewed as a shaky flex option for 2020 in a run-heavy Broncos offense and with Drew Lock still an unknown.","","Michel remains New England's lead rusher as he enters his third professional season, but this offense certainly has a different feel to it with Tom Brady out of the picture. Thus far, Michel has essentially been limited to a situational, between-the-tackles hammer role. In 29 regular-season games, he has played 37% of the snaps and handled 54% of the carries (15.7 per game) and 3% of the targets (1.1 per game). That usage allowed Michel only two top-20 fantasy weeks in 2019. Perhaps New England will lean more on its 2018 first-round pick with Brady gone, but with his nonexistent role as a receiver and with James White, Rex Burkhead and Damien Harris in the fold, Michel should be viewed as only a flex option in non-PPR leagues.","The Rams' D/ST finished as fantasy's No. 9 scoring unit last season, which marks its third consecutive top 10 and seventh finish of 12th or better over the past eight seasons. The Rams finished eighth or better in forced turnovers and D/ST touchdowns for the third straight season. Los Angeles' 11 top-10 fantasy weeks last season led the league. Seven of those came in 10 games after Jalen Ramsey joined the team. Despite the strong finish, there's reason for some concern here. Ramsey is back (as are Aaron Donald and John Johnson), but three of the defense's top four snap-getters from 2019 (Cory Littleton, Dante Fowler and Eric Weddle) are among the departed, leaving the team with shaky situations at edge rusher, linebacker and corner.

caught an incredible 149 passes in 2019. That was more catches than his 2018 target total. Amazing! With Drew Brees back under center, you can expect more of the same for the elite fantasy receiver. He's the top WR option in the NFL heading into the season opener against Tampa Bay.","It's still not clear if Jacobs will earn more snaps and targets on third down in his second year, but it's fairly obvious he's the lead early-down option for the Raiders. This role could prove particularly productive to open this season given the Panthers allowed the fifth-most fantasy points and the most rushing yards to opposing backs last season.","Ertz has been one of the most reliable offensive options for the Eagles, scoring 22 touchdowns over the past three years. His expected level of performance is probably more along the lines of his 14.4 points per game from 2019 than the 17.5 points per game outburst in 2018, but that's more than good enough for fantasy managers. Set and forget him as your tight end every week.","Cooper has stepped his game up since joining the Cowboys in 2018, and he posted the best fantasy scoring average of his career in 2019 when paired with Dak Prescott and the rest of the Dallas offense for a full campaign. The Rams finished in the middle of the pack last season in terms of allowing WR fantasy points, so this is a solid opportunity for Cooper to begin the season strong. Assuming he's healthy, he's an easy pick as a WR1/WR2 for your Week 1 fantasy lineup.","The second-round pick out of Florida State ran for 14 touchdowns in his final season with the Seminoles and caught four more but, with the Rams, he certainly isn't guaranteed the 261 touches he got at the college level. He should factor heavily into his team's RB plans, but Malcolm Brown will get his fair share of snaps, as well. Heading into Week 1, Akers seems like the better fantasy option of the pair, but you should consider him more of a low-end RB2 in his NFL debut.","The league leader in dropbacks, attempts, and completions back in 2018, Roethlisberger was unquestionably elite during his last healthy season. A soft opening matchup awaits Roethlisberger and vaults him into the QB1 tier for this week, as only the Cardinals and Dolphins allowed more fantasy points to opposing passers than the Giants. ","Gallup burst onto the scene in 2019, rivaling Amari Cooper in most statistical categories, and becoming a solid fantasy option. The addition of first-round pick CeeDee Lamb complicates things a bit, but you should trust in Gallup's talent. After all, the 2018 third-round pick out of Colorado State is no stranger to big numbers as a wideout. He had almost 2,700 yards over his final two seasons in college. Against a mediocre Rams pass defense, Gallup is a solid WR3/flex option for Week 1.","We checked and you don't get more fantasy points for looking cool while smoking a cigar, although Burrow tried his hardest. The poised rookie signal-caller faces an immediate test with the Chargers' deep and dangerous pass rush up first. There will be some fun weeks that Burrow will flirt with streaming value, but this likely isn't the right matchup just yet.","With the third-most rushing yards in the NFL since 2016, Howard brings some potential as a helpful fantasy option in standard (non-PPR) fantasy formats as Miami's bruiser. The downside for this first matchup is somewhat clear, with New England's stingy defense surrendering just 76.1 rushing yards per game to backs last season, fifth fewest in the NFL.","A surname ideal for creative fantasy team names helps Fant's already rising value. One of the most productive tight ends last year in regards to yards after the catch and contact, albeit over a small sample of touches, Fant now needs a leap in market share to ascend to TE1 status. A solid test of his potential comes in Week 1 against a Titans defense that allowed the eighth-most yards to tight ends in 2019.","Anderson was fun to watch during his time with the Jets, as his top-end speed was among the best in the NFL despite a less-than-ideal QB situation during his tenure there. He'll now join Teddy Bridgewater in Carolina and he'll be helped by lining up with D.J. Moore on the other side of the field. That said, Anderson has yet to prove to be a consistent fantasy option, and is no more than a flex flier until he takes the next step with his new team.","The New England D/ST led the league in fantasy scoring by a whopping 43 points last year thanks in part to allowing 47 fewer actual points to opponents. Facing Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Dolphins to begin the season sets up the potential for sacks, turnovers, and rewarding point and yardage allowances for this stout defense.","Isolated to a third-down role and now with more competition for such work with the presence of a gifted rookie running back on the team, Hines doesn't present much fantasy value even amid a friendly opening matchup.","Peterson rushed the ball 211 times in his age-34 season a year ago but was let go by Washington and picked up by the Lions just ahead of Week 1 action. The backfield situation in Detroit is unclear at best, but rookie D'Andre Swift will likely be the main back when healthy. Should Swift miss time, Peterson could see a healthy number of touches. Still, it's tough to bank on that for your Week 1 fantasy lineups.",null],"2":["It was already a subpar opener for Thomas, who had reeled in just three balls for 17 yards. Then, late in the fourth quarter, Alvin Kamara hit Thomas on the back of the leg, causing him to suffer a high-ankle sprain. The star wideout will likely be out for several weeks.","It was a great outing for Jacobs in the opener against the Panthers; the second-year tailback tallied a career-high three touchdowns and set career highs in receptions and receiving yardage. Emergence as an every-down back vaults Jacobs into the RB1 mix for this meeting with a capable Saints defense.","Ertz is consistently the recipient of extra attention from opposing defenses and when the focus is combined with a strong pass rush, Ertzâ€™s numbers can suffer. Such was the case in Week 1 as the Washington defense kept Ertz in check after an early touchdown, holding him to only three catches for 18 yards and the score. The Rams have a chance to do the same in Week 2, though Ertz is a must-start. After all, the Eagles always look to get him involved, regardless of the matchup.","Cooper fell short of the century mark and didnâ€™t reach the end zone in Week 1, but catching 10 passes for 81 yards is still solid production. Heâ€™s in store for another big week, facing an Atlanta defense which allowed 322 passing yards and four scores to the Seahawks. Cooper remains the top dog in Dallas and a must-start WR1 for fantasy.","Akers got his fair share of carries in his NFL debut, but couldn't make the most of them, picking up only 39 yards on 14 attempts. Meanwhile, Malcolm Brown had a fantastic day as the starter and appears to be the Rams' top RB option. Akers' playing time was encouraging, but don't pencil him into your starting lineup just yet.","Becoming just the eighth player in NFL history with 50 career games with at least three touchdown passes, Roethlisberger shook off the early rust against the Giants to deliver a solid line in the end. The Broncos are missing key pass rush talent at this stage, aiding Roethlisberger's solid streaming value.","While Gallup caught a modest three passes for 50 yards in Week 1, it could have been more if he hadnâ€™t been flagged for offensive pass interference, taking away a 47-yard gain that would have put the Cowboys in position to kick a late game-tying field goal. More importantly, even though he lead  Dallas receivers in snaps, Gallup isnâ€™t the clear cut No. 2 receiving option with rookie Ceedee Lamb in the picture. Even so, Gallup is a WR2/WR3 option for Week 2 as the Cowboys should be able to throw against the soft Falcons secondary.","With Burrow's close loss this past Sunday, No. 1 draft picks are now winless in their last 13 starts to open their career (0-12-1). It was positive for his fantasy profile to see Burrow scramble for 46 yards on the ground, including a 23-yard score. The passing results were ugly at just 5.4 yards per attempt, but the Chargers are a top pass defense. An in-state matchup with Cleveland's blitz-heavy defense results in Burrow as a mid-tier QB2.","It's probably not good to have more touches than yards, which was the case for Howard this past week. In what now appears to be a murky committee with Matt Brieda and Myles Gaskin, Howard enters Week 2 against a top defense without any real fantasy appeal.","An awesome outing against the Titans netted Fant 56 yards after the catch and a touchdown. The Steelers have been solid against tight ends dating back to last season, but at least Fant claims a rewarding share of the Denver offense heading into the tough matchup.","Andersonâ€™s first game with his new team was a success, fueled by a 75-yard TD catch, one of six receptions for 115 yards. Anderson is athletic and capable of making big plays. Just donâ€™t expect the same level of production each week, beginning with a Week 2 meeting with an improved Tampa Bay unit. That said, the Buccaneers secondary is young and susceptible to deep threats, so Anderson checks in as a WR3/flex option.","With three picks in the opener, the Patriots picked up where last year left off when they led the league with 25 total picks. Russell Wilson presents a unique challenge for this group, but their strong point and yardage metrics over the past year suggest fantasy value is still present.","With 27 routes run and two scores in Week 1, Hines was at his playmaking best as a change-of-pace threat for the Colts. A season-ending injury to Marlon Mack supports increased work for Hines ahead, especially as 37% of Rivers' targets went to backs in Week 1. The Vikings are proving inconsistent on defense, with Hines entering the matchup as a risky flex option. ","Peterson touched the ball on 17 of his 24 offensive snaps in Week 1, leading the Lions in rushing, despite having just joined the club days prior. Detroit has several options at running back but, at this point, Peterson seems to be the best of the bunch. That said, he will likely cede passing-game targets to his teammates and play on only a limited number of snaps, so he is a risky flex option in Week 2 against a Green Bay defense that kept Dalvin Cook in check to start the season.",null],"3":["Thomas missed the Monday night affair with a high-ankle sprain. The initial diagnosis was for Thomas to be out  2-to-4 weeks, but he's recovering faster than expected, to the point that he actually heads into Week 3 as only questionable. Monitor the practice reports as it's unlikely the Saints will ask Thomas to be a decoy or to risk further injury. If he's active for New Orleans, he should be active for you.","A true every-down threat now that the Raiders are allowing Jacobs to handle the majority of receiving routes out of the backfield, Jacobs handled a whopping 30 touches in a big Week 2 showing. The Patriots are better against the pass than the ground game, so Jacobs will prove busy this week as the offensive engine for Las Vegas.","Those expending an early pick on Ertz typically expect around eight catches for 60 yards and a touchdown per game. Unfortunately, that's his current stat line through the first two contests. Ertz's woes are more than just facing good TE defenses. After all, teammate Dallas Goedert has excelled in the early going. Regardless, Ertz has a strong chance of getting back on track against the Bengals, who are the league's most generous pass defense.","After a late-season slide in 2019, Cooper's draft stock dipped a bit for 2020.  Thus far, he's rewarding those who took the chance on him.  Although Cooper has yet to score a touchdown in what has otherwise been a solid start to the 2020 campaign, that could change this week. He takes on a depleted Seahawks secondary allowing a league-high 731 yards to receivers -- over 200 more than the next closest team.","Akers suffered a rib injury in Week 2 and might not be fully healthy by the time Week 3's contest with Buffalo rolls around. The rookie was splitting time at running back, anyway, and this likely means he'll take more of a reserve role behind the duo of Malcolm Brown and Darrell Henderson Jr. against the Bills. Keep him on the bench.","Two scores in Week 2's win gives Roethlisberger 368 career passing touchdowns, passing Eli Manning for eighth in league history. Next up is a somewhat inviting matchup with Houston, a defense allowing 19 fantasy points per game to quarterbacks and without many playmakers in the back seven.","With so many talented players, someone on the Cowboys is likely to come out on the short end of the stick. In Week 2, that was Gallup, who captured just 2-of-5 targets for 58 yards. He should get more looks against a Seahawks defense that was torched by both Matt Ryan and Cam Newton for a combined 831 yards over the first two weeks. Until Ceedee Lamb leapfrogs to No. 2 on the Cowboys' WR depth chart, Gallup remains a solid WR3.","Fresh from producing the most completions in a game by an NFL rookie, Burrow next faces a motivated Philadelphia defense that has struggled to contain opposing passers. While the Eagles have some talent on the line, a thin back seven could help Burrow deliver another solid statistical showing.","An inefficient start to his career with the Dolphins has left Howard without much fantasy appeal entering Week 3. The meaningful passing downs are going to Myles Gaskin, while Howard has been stuffed on many of his own early-down opportunities. The Jaguars aren't stingy against the run, but Howard's just not in a good spot to deliver fantasy fun. ","With Denver's receiving corps ravaged by injuries, Fant could serve a big role in the team's passing offense going forward. The Buccaneers have been solid against tight ends this season, but Fant's blend of athleticism and usage makes for a fun streaming option. ","In Week 2, Anderson eclipsed the century mark in receiving yards for the second straight week, only one fewer time than all of last season. He'll be hard-pressed to make it three straight weeks facing a Chargers secondary that was able to hold Tyreek Hill to only 99 yards last week. Anderson's early success merits flex consideration, but don't get used to this level of production.","An early pick-six boosted this group's fantasy output in Week 2. The Raiders have one of the league's better protection rates on the offensive line, but the Patriots' stingy overall defensive metrics merits trust in all leagues.","On the field for only three plays in the second half to Jordan Wilkins' 15, Hines also lost out on receiving duties with Jonathan Taylor doubling him in routes run. Without an important slice of the offense if such usage patterns persist, Hines is an easy fade heading into a matchup with a struggling Jets defense.","Peterson saw his carries cut in half in Week 2, as the Lions moved to a true three-man rotation at the RB position. As such, none of the trio (Peterson, D'Andre Swift and Kerryon Johnson) merit consideration for your fantasy lineup, even against an Arizona defense which has allowed the fifth-most RB fantasy points this season.",null],"4":["After missing the past two games, Thomas hopes to return to practice this week and may well suit up against the Lions on Sunday. Thomas' return would be timely as Detroit has surrendered the eighth-most yards to opposing wideouts, along with four touchdowns. If Thomas is active for the Saints, he should be active for you.","Held to 71 scrimmage yards on 16 carries with no touchdowns in a modest Week 3 showing, Jacobs troublingly lost some work on third downs in the loss. The hope is Jacobs, a proven RB1 option by now, returns to a busier every-down role in a matchup with a tough Bills defense allowing just 22 fantasy points per game to backfields. ","While Ertz has been steady, he's yet to register the dominating type of game expected from a top-three tight end. It could happen in Week 4 as his target share should increase with Dallas Goedert out. Against an injury-riddled San Francisco secondary, look for Ertz to finally reward those expending significant draft capital on the tight end.","Even though Cooper has yet to find the end zone this season, he's been productive, averaging eight-plus receptions for almost 90 yards a game. He's in a great spot to notch his first score in Week 4, lining up against a Browns secondary that has already relinquished five TD passes. Cooper may not be a WR1, but this could be the week he busts out with a top-10 effort at the position.","With Akers sidelined in Week 3, Darrell Henderson Jr. stepped up and provided the Rams with an excellent performance out of the backfield. Looking ahead to Week 4, even if Akers returns, Henderson appears to have claimed the top spot at running back here and is the player to start in fantasy.","This week's game has been postponed and will be played later in the season.","In Week 3, Gallup more than doubled his seasonal yardage output, garnering 138 yards on six catches and his first score of the season. Dak Prescott likely won't throw for another 450-plus yards this week, but Gallup's big-play ability keeps him in the running for a WR3/flex designation against a Browns secondary that has given up five WR touchdowns.","In becoming the first rookie QB in Bengals history with consecutive 300-yard passing games, Burrow is becoming an intriguing fantasy option early into his career. With the Jaguars allowing 2.9 points per drive to opponents, the fourth-highest clip in the league, Burrow is positioned to produce a strong streaming performance.","As a tribute to Jerome Bettis, Howard handled three touches while producing a single yard and added another touchdown. Without any real value between the 20s, it's wise to fade Howard ahead of a difficult matchup with a solid Seattle rush defense.","A spike in attention saw Fant earn a team-high 10 targets in Week 3. With the team's receiving corps so young and missing proven veteran production to injury, Fant could again prove busy against the Jets, a team allowing nearly 15 fantasy points per game to tight ends.","After eclipsing the century mark in both of the first two games, Anderson registered only 55 yards on five catches in Week 3. Still, Anderson led Panthers wideouts with six targets and has established himself as a presence on his new team. With a decent floor and big-play ability, Anderson has earned WR3/flex status.","Another week and another series of big plays from the Patriots defense in a win over the Raiders. This coming week, of course, is a much different story given the Patriots face an elite Kansas City offense. It's difficult to not use a strong D/ST, but it could be wise to stream another group and stash the Patriots for a week. ","Grinding out 61 scrimmage yards and nearly matching Jonathan Taylor in touches reveals that Hines will continue to play a sizable role from the Colts' backfield. The Bears are allowing a generous 4.9 yards per carry to backs this year, eighth most in the NFL, but Hines will need to surface as a productive receiver to help fantasy managers.","The veteran back has settled into a starter's role for the Lions, handling 23 touches in Week 3 and leading the team in snaps out of the backfield. His playing time increase coming out of Week 2 against the Packers is an encouraging sign, making him a borderline start-worthy option moving forward. The Saints have allowed the ninth-fewest RB fantasy points this season, but you can still consider the high-volume Peterson for your flex spot.",null],"5":["After practicing on a limited basis last week, the Saints hope Thomas will be ready to come back and play for the first time since suffering a high-ankle sprain in the season opener. If Thomas is 100%, expect him to make up for lost time, facing a Chargers defense allowing the 12th-most yards to wideouts in the NFL.","Deploying more help in the backfield is coming at the expense of Jacobs' fantasy profile; three other backs had at least two touches in Week 4. The Chiefs are allowing 4.99 yards per rush to tailbacks, so Jacobs could find some big lanes as the Raiders' early-down engine this week. ","Ertz continues to be one of fantasy's biggest disappointments as he was held to just four catches for nine yards in Week 4, his lowest total from scrimmage since 2015. Week 5 poses another difficult matchup as the Steelers have held opposing tight ends to an average of just 3.7 catches for 41.3 yards. However, Ertz isn't your average tight end. He has earned TE1 status, regardless of the foe.","Cooper had his best game of the season last Sunday, reeling in 12-of-16 targets for 134 yards and his first score. He's been helped by the Cowboys need to throw often as they have played much of the last three games  from behind. With the low-scoring Giants on tap, Cooper's volume could be down, but it should still be ample enough for him to be a low-end WR1.","Akers has missed two straight games and his status for Week 5 is still up in the air. If he returns, he'll join a crowded Rams backfield and likely slot in as the No. 3 option, making him a non-factor in fantasy.","An early unexpected bye gave the veteran signal-caller more time to prepare for an Eagles defense that rates second in the league in sack rate while sustaining a strong pressure rate. If Roethlisberger has time to operate, a big day could unfold for this Pittsburgh passing game given how beatable Philadelphia's back seven proves.   ","Considering the Cowboys have thrown for -- by far -- the most yards in the league, Gallup must be considered a disappointment through four games. He checks in as only the 32nd-ranked wideout, losing target shares to rookie wideout Ceedee Lamb. With Dak Prescott running the show for Dallas, Gallup always has a chance for a big game. However, facing a Giants secondary allowing the sixth-fewest passing yards per game, Gallup is no better than a flex for this NFC East affair.","It's impressive that Burrow is the first rookie in NFL history with three straight 300-yard passing games. Yet, the touchdowns aren't surfacing just yet in Cincinnati's passing game. With Burrow facing a tough Baltimore defense allowing just 6.26 yards per dropback, it's likely best you find a stronger streaming candidate this week.","It's probably not a good thing that Howard netted negative yardage last week. Struggling badly to get untracked as a rusher and with just a handful of looks each week, Howard isn't a relevant fantasy play against the 49ers' solid front.","The game between the Patriots and the Broncos has been postponed. Both teams will be on a bye for Week 5.","Anderson rebounded from last week's mediocre performance, barely missing the century mark with 99 yards receiving. It would have been the third time for Anderson to surpass the 100-yard plateau. Anderson has yet to score, but that could change this week as the Panthers visit Atlanta, whose secondary has allowed the most TD catches in the league. Anderson's production over the first quarter of the season places him as a strong WR2 in Week 5.","The game between the Patriots and the Broncos has been postponed. Both teams will be on a bye for Week 5.","Afforded 14 routes as the team's resident third-down receiving threat out of the backfield this past Sunday, Hines should again serve a similar role against the Browns this week. It helps Hines' case as a flex in deeper leagues that Cleveland has allowed 51.5 receiving yards per game to tailbacks.",null,null],"7":["Thomas was nursing an ankle sprain prior to Week 5's Monday night affair with the Chargers but the official reason for his being inactive was a suspension for getting into a scuffle with a teammate. With the off week to further heal, Thomas should be ready to return to the field. However, as of Monday, Sean Payton had yet to formally lift the suspension. Assuming Thomas plays, he remains one of the top wideouts in the league.","Two touchdowns defined Jacobs' big Week 5 showing against the Chiefs. It also helped his tally that positive game flow afforded him 25 touches. Next up is a game against a stellar rush defense, with Tampa allowing only 2.8 yards per carry to tailbacks, the lowest allowance in the NFL. Thanks to having a nice stake of work in the red zone, Jacobs is a surefire starting option.","Ertz's already frustrating campaign took a turn for the worst as he is slated to miss the next 3-4 weeks with a high-ankle sprain.","Cooper was the beneficiary of Week 6 garbage time, including a late touchdown capping a game where he caught seven passes for 79 yards. This week, Cooper draws a tough Washington secondary that is allowing the fewest WR fantasy points per game. Even so, as one of Andy Dalton's primary targets, Cooper is an automatic start.","Akers hardly saw the field in Week 6 against the 49ers while Darrell Henderson Jr. continued to establish himself as the Rams' No. 1 back. Akers is a name to know for dynasty and keeper formats, but for those in redraft leagues, he belongs on the waiver wire due to a lack of playing time.","A key reason the Steelers are 5-0 for the first time since 1978 is that Roethlisberger has been pressured on only 18% of his dropbacks for the season, which would be his lowest clip since ESPN began tracking pressures in 2009. The Titans have actually been somewhat generous to opposing passers this season in allowing 21 fantasy points per game to the position, helping Roethlisberger's case as a solid starter.","Gallup's six targets in Week 6 were more a result of Andy Dalton need to air the ball out 54 times than Gallup's play. The receiver caught just a pair of passes for 23 yards while mishandling a potential touchdown. Next up is the formidable Washington defense. With Amari Cooper and Ceedee Lamb both producing at a higher level, there isn't enough remaining for Gallup to be in the fantasy mix.","Burrow impressively produced 313 yards against one of the league's best pass defenses and built a 21-0 lead, while also playing a role in the second-largest blown lead in team history. Burrow struggled when under duress in the pocket; the rookie entered the day with a 4.8 QBR under pressure, 29th among 32 qualified QBs. With Cleveland ranked just 25th in pressuring passers, at least Burrow could have some time to operate this week. Given the Bengals' lack of scoring pop in the passing phase, you can find a stronger option than Burrow.",null,"Limited work in practice could signal an impending return to action for this talented young tight end. If he's able to play, Fant faces a Chiefs back seven allowing just 10.5 fantasy points per game to the position. Lock seems to like targeting his tight ends in the red zone, aiding Fant's case as a fantasy starter if he's ready to go for this division battle.","Anderson has been mostly working underneath since joining Carolina. In Week 6, he shook free for a couple of long gains against the Bears, catching four balls for 77 yards, good for a season-high 19.3 yards per reception. This week, Anderson faces a Saints secondary that has been victimized for 15 WR touchdowns in five games. All of this lands Anderson as a solid fantasy WR2 for Week 7.","A sluggish pass rush makes it tougher to really love this group's fantasy profile, although the Patriots have produced at least eight fantasy points in three of five outings. The 49ers are finally finding some balance on offense, leaving New England as a streaming option among defenses.",null,"Peterson found the end zone and handled 15 carries with a catch in Week 6, but he was outdone in snaps, yards and touchdowns by D'Andre Swift. The two seem to still be splitting time and chances in the Detroit backfield, rather than things moving closer to being a one-man show. That said, Swift might well have the upper hand after a solid outing. The Falcons have one of the worst defenses in football, so Peterson is worth a flier as a flex in deeper leagues if you're running out of options.",null],"8":["Just as Thomas appeared ready to return from an ankle sprain, he suffered a Grade 1 hamstring strain during practice last week, keeping him out of Week 7's NFC South affair with the Panthers. Thomas is questionable for this week's trip to Soldier Field. If Thomas can go against the Bears, he'll be his usual strong play. Watch the injury reports.","With the Raiders trailing throughout to Tampa Bay last week while facing the league's top rush defense, Jacobs understandably struggled. Even as the Browns have been respectable against the rush this season, Jacobs is poised for a big workload in a game with Cleveland that should prove far friendlier in regards to game flow than this past week.",null,"Cooper managed to stay productive in Week 7, despite the Cowboys' woes under center, catching all seven targets for 80 yards -- which represented 70% of the team's production through the air against Washington. He'll be hard-pressed to repeat this week as the Eagles defense allows an average of just 13 WR catches per game. Cooper will compete with Ceedee Lamb and Michael Gallup for his target share. Even so, Cooper still profiles as a WR2 and should be active for Week 8.","Akers is not in the Rams' offensive gameplan at the moment, with Darrell Henderson Jr. and Malcolm Brown leading the way at running back. The rookie will need to make a move up the depth chart in order to merit a spot on your fantasy squad in anything but a dynasty or keeper league.","Week 8 will mark the first meeting ever between Ben Roethlisberger and Lamar Jackson. This epic matchup of different approaches will be fun to watch, especially as Roethlisberger continues his Drew Brees impersonation this season as an elite game manager, rather than downfield playmaker. The Ravens present a real challenge this week given such a deep and dynamic defensive roster and aggressive, relentless blitz schemes.","Gallup's role in the Cowboys offense was already on the downturn but Week 7 was the low-water mark as he was targeted just twice, unable to handle either offering. It doesn't portend to get better for Gallup with inadequate QB play since Dak Prescott was ruled out for the season. If you've still been sticking with Gallup on your roster, it's time to cut him loose.","Fresh from a high-scoring loss to the Browns, this year's top pick has already amassed five 300-yard showings, one shy of the all-time rookie record held by Andrew Luck. In the dramatic game with Cleveland, Burrow also became the first rookie in league history to produce at least 350 yards passing with three passing scores and a rushing score. It's this level of production that fuels Burrow's solid projection for this matchup with the Titans, a defense allowing 19.6 fantasy points per game to opposing arms.",null,"Fant was only able to secure three of his seven targets in Week 7, but it was promising that he was third on the team in routes run. The Chargers have allowed nearly 14 fantasy points per game to tight ends, which aids Fant's prospects as a streaming candidate this week.","Anderson continues to be one of the most reliable wide receivers in the game, catching another six balls for 74 yards in Week 7. As a testament to his solid campaign, the yardage total was his second-lowest of the season. Anderson is in a great position for another productive week, facing a Falcons secondary which has allowed the second-most passing yards and WR touchdowns per game.","The 49ers pushed this front seven around last week. With this Patriots' defense often struggling to contain dynamic rushing offenses on the edge, this matchup with an improved Buffalo offense isn't very appealing.","You'd thing that a pass-heavy comeback effort for the Colts would play into Hines' workload, but he wasn't a factor against the Bengals a few weeks back. There isn't much to like about his prospects this week outside of the fact Detroit just isn't good at defending running backs. That usually helps, but Hines is still in line for a small role.","Peterson could only watch as D'Andre Swift handled a bigger workload in the passing game and scored a touchdown on a handoff while the veteran was limited to just 30 total yards on 12 touches. None of the Detroit backs could gain traction on the ground, but Swift led the way in snaps and touches and appears to be the back to trust moving forward. That means Peterson belongs on the bench for Week 8, especially against a stalwart Indianapolis defense.",null],"9":["Thomas remained on the shelf in Week 8, making it now six games in a row that he's missed. The Saints are hoping he can suit up for this week's rematch with Tampa Bay, but Thomas begins the week as questionable. If he's active, Thomas is an automatic start. Still, temper your expectations as the Buccaneers sport a solid pass defense, yielding the eighth-fewest WR fantasy points per game.","Fresh from his first 100-yard rushing outing this season, Jacobs enters this matchup of rivals with some nice momentum. The early-down maven faces a Los Angeles defense allowing 4.8 yards per carry to backs, setting up the Alabama product as a legitimate RB1 option for Week 9.",null,"Cooper was nearly invisible in Week 8, catching just one ball for a measly five yards. Granted, the Cowboys were down to their No. 3 option at quarterback, but more is expected from their top wideout. Ben DiNucci will start again in Week 9, so it is unlikely that Cooper will return to fantasy relevance -- especially not in a game against a stingy Steelers secondary.",null,"Helping lead the Steelers to the second 7-0 start in franchise history, Roethlisberger's game manager role this season has been played nearly perfectly by the veteran slinger. Roethlisberger completed all but two of his 20 attempts out of empty sets this past week, helping offset the Ravens' blitz packages. The Cowboys' messy defense might be the best matchup in football right now for a quarterback, thus Roethlisberger is a solid starting option.","After being shut out the previous game, Gallup rebounded in Week 8, catching 7-of-12 targets for 61 yards. The volume was Gallup's heaviest all season but still doesn't move the needle enough for him to be a fantasy factor, especially facing the Steelers' talented defense on Sunday.",null,null,"Fed nine targets and finishing second on the team in targets per route run in Week 8, Fant is in a good spot to deliver a strong showing this week facing a Falcons defense that has allowed the most fantasy points per game to tight ends. Given how shallow tight end has proven this season, Fant is well positioned as a starting option.","After eclipsing 50 yards in each of the Panthers' first seven games, Anderson fell two yards short in Week 8 as the Falcons defense held him to an average of 9.6 YPC on his five grabs. Week 9 brings a Chiefs secondary allowing the third-fewest points to opposing wideouts. Still, Anderson has emerged as Teddy Bridgewater's favorite target so he should be busy, especially since Carolina will likely be forced to throw to keep up with Kansas City's beefy offense.","This is a fun week to roster a Patriots D/ST that hasn't delivered a big game in weeks. Due for a solid outing and set with a prime matchup against a sloppy Jets offense, New England is among the stronger plays at the position this week.","Two receiving touchdowns for Hines defined his performance last week, but he wasn't very involved or productive outside of these high-value touches. It's not wise to bet on touchdown production from a third-down back, especially against Baltimore -- one of the league's better front seven groups.","Peterson may be inspired to perform against his former team, but he's going to need playing time in Week 9 to be a viable fantasy option against Minnesota. He handled a season-low six touches in Week 8 while D'Andre Swift continues to run away with the playing time at the RB position. It's much easier to trust Swift with a starting spot in your lineup, and Peterson would be an incredibly risky option, even against a below-average Minnesota run defense.",null],"10":["Various injuries and a suspension kept Thomas off the gridiron since opening week. He finally suited up again in Week 9, catching five balls for 51 yards. Perhaps because he was drawing coverage away from his teammates, Thomas' targets were low as Dree Brees was able to connect with 11 other Saints pass catchers. Most importantly, Thomas didn't appear to suffer any health setbacks so look for him to return to WR1 status in Week 10's date with an injury-riddled 49ers defense.","An awesome season opener for Jacobs has led to some inconstant performances in the weeks since. The team has scaled back his receiving role and presence on third downs in the weeks since, isolating Jacobs to produce only on early downs and around the red zone. Denver has been respectable against the run this year, but Jacobs still enters Week 10 with appeal as an RB1 candidate given real potential for around 20 touches.",null,null,"Akers did handle 10 touches in Week 8, his best total since his debut to start the season. But he's not proven to be a consistent member of the offense and his surge in volume against Miami was partially fueled by Darrell Henderson Jr.'s injury absence. Henderson seems set to return in Week 10, so Akers belongs on the fantasy bench.","Roethlisberger was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list on Tuesday after being in close contact with tight end Vance McDonald, who tested positive for COVID-19. Roethlisberger will have to self isolate this week and won't be able to practice, but if he tests negative for five days he could still play in Week 10. Keep on eye on this leading up until kickoff.",null,"With just two performances shy of 16 fantasy points through his first eight starts, Burrow has established himself as a solid streaming option this early into his career. Unfortunately, the rookie's first game after the bye is a brutal matchup with arguably the league's top defense, as Pittsburgh's relentless pass rush curbs statistical enthusiasm for the rookie this week.","Howard was a healthy scratch for three games before being activated for Week 9's encounter with Arizona. With Myles Gaskin on the IL and Matt Breida unable to play, Howard rushed 10 times for just 19 yards, but salvaged his fantasy production with a two-yard scoring scamper. Jordan is in line for a similar workload and role in this week's meeting with the Chargers, but the volume is far from being fantasy relevant.","A gifted playmaker from the tight end position, Fant hasn't yet developed an enduring chemistry with Drew Lock. Sent only three targets this past week, we'll want to see an uptick in usage before really trusting Fant as a bankable fantasy starter. It's worth noting the Raiders have been somewhat solid in coverage against tight ends thus far, surrendering just 10.6 fantasy points per game to the position.","Anderson was targeted a season-high 13 times, catching nine for 63 yards in Carolina's Week 9 loss in Kansas City. Sunday brings a Week 2 rematch with the Buccaneers where Anderson also reeled in nine balls, totaling 109 yards. Anderson may have snuck up on Tampa Bay last time but even if they're ready for him, he's Teddy Bridgewater's favorite wideout and should continue to put up WR1/WR2 numbers.","With just three fantasy points against Joe Flacco and the Jets and with a glaringly low sack rate overall on defense, this New England D/ST isn't a great play against a run-centric Baltimore offense.","Isolated to a change-of-pace role on third downs, Hines doesn't help fantasy managers save for the rogue big play or random red zone success. Which is to say, it's difficult to project when Hines will deliver big plays given such a specialized role in a poor offense. The Titans, meanwhile, have allowed the sixth-fewest receiving yards per game to backfields.","Peterson did not fare well against the Vikings in Week 9, racking up only 29 yards on eight rushing attempts. D'Andre Swift leads the backfield in Detroit and seems to be outperforming his colleagues, meaning he's the back to start in your fantasy lineup, not Peterson.",null],"11":["Thomas has yet to get back on track after returning from assorted woes in Week 9, as he caught just 2-of-7 targets for 27 yards in the Saints' Week 10 win over San Francisco. Now Thomas needs to get on the same page as either Jameis Winston or Taysom Hill (or perhaps both) with Drew Brees out. Resist the temptation to bench Thomas, even with the uncertainty at quarterback. He remains a must-play against the Falcons in Week 11.","Jacobs gained 71 of his 112 rush yards before initial contact this past Sunday against Denver, marking his most in a game this season. Jacobs went untouched on each of his two rushing scores in the win and for the game averaged a career-high 3.38 yards per rush before contact, the highest average by a Raiders back since Latavius Murray in 2016. Jacobs scored twice against the Chiefs back in Week 5 and should be considered a strong starting option in the rematch this week.","After being \"designated to return,\" Zach Ertz has a three-week window to practice before he has to be activated from the IR and there's an outside chance he'll be ready as soon as Week 11. A healthy Ertz has usually been a fantasy star but, with his tepid production thus far in 2020 when healthy, he's best considered as no more than a bye-week fill-in until he proves worthy of every-week deployment.","After failing to get in sync with Ben DiNucci in Week 8, Cooper and Garrett Gilbert were on the same page in Week 9. Cooper hauled in five balls for 67 yards, along with a rush for eight yards. Week 11 not only marks the likely return of Andy Dalton, but Dallas is slated to face one of the softest secondaries in the league when they travel to Minnesota. Consider Cooper to be a WR3 play.","Akers' involvement in the Los Angeles offense continued to pick up in Week 10 as the rookie carried 10 times for 38 yards. However, he remained a non-entity in the passing game in the Rams' victory over the Seahawks. Despite the added workload, Akers is still in a committee with Malcolm Brown and Darrell Henderson, keeping Akers on the fantasy sideline for Week 11's Monday night game in Tampa Bay.","The Steelers remain unbeaten in part thanks to Roethlisberger's awesome four-score showing this past week. Thriving in empty sets of late, Roethlisberger was 9-of-16 for 109 yards and two scores when he was alone in the backfield. Through the first nine weeks, Roethlisberger leads the league in the shortest average time to throw (2.18 seconds), making it tough for Jacksonville's already weak pass rush to muster any real threat this week.","Gallup continued to struggle without Dak Prescott under center, reeling in just three balls for 36 yards back in Week 8. Even with the possibility that Andy Dalton returns in Week 11 against a Vikings secondary allowing the second-most WR fantasy points per game, Gallup's production is too uneven to trust for your fantasy lineup.","Burrow was blitzed on 16 of 44 dropbacks (36%) completing 5-of-14 passes for 154 yards with a TD and 2 sacks. It was the second time this season that Burrow was sacked multiple times on the blitz. ",null,"With this second-year talent still surfacing on the injury report each week, it's possible that a lingering ankle ailment could be the culprit for his suspect production of late. There is still some streaming appeal present for this talented seam target against an exploitable back seven this week, but the risk is just as clear, as well.","Anderson registered his lowest output of the season in the Panthers' Week 10 loss to the Buccaneers, corralling just four balls for a season-low 21 yards. Expect a more typical showing this week at home against the Lions. Anderson remains a solid every-week fantasy start.","Once a dangerous pass rush, the Patriots haven't topped two sacks in a single game this season. The Texans' Deshaun Watson has had success against the Patriots in prior meetings, while New England's lack of splash plays keeps them in the streaming tier of defenses this week.","A spectacular performance this past Thursday saw Hines prove effective as both a rusher and receiver in an impressive multi-score outing. While it's honestly difficult to bank on Hines delivering such effective work in the red zone this week against the Packers, it helps his case as a flex candidate that the team appears open to riding whoever the hot hand in the backfield happens to be. ","Peterson took a backseat to upstart rookie D'Andre Swift in Week 10's win over Washington, carrying just four times for 21 yards, his second-lowest output of the season. It will be telling how much action Peterson sees this week as Detroit draws a Panthers defense giving up the fourth-most RB fantasy points per game. That said, it appears Swift will again be the primary ball-carrier, pushing Peterson out of the fantasy picture.",null],"12":["In Week 11, Thomas enjoyed the best game of his injury-riddled 2020 season, catching 9-of-12 looks for 104 yards as the Saints handily defeated the Falcons. It was encouraging to see Thomas and QB Taysom Hill on the same page since Hill is slated to lead the offense again in Week 12 when the Saints march to Denver. Thomas is back to being an automatic start in Week 12, going up against a league-average secondary.","Unable to get much going after an early touchdown against the Chiefs this past Sunday night, Jacobs remains a strong fantasy option if for his rewarding goal-line role. The Falcons have actually held backfields in check for much of this season, but Jacobs' solid workload and strong red zone role support a healthy projection.",null,"Cooper stepped up in the Cowboys' Week 11 victory in Minnesota, bagging 6-of-7 targets for 81 yards, all team-highs. Cooper will likely be one of Andy Dalton's primary targets in the Thanksgiving game with Washington. However, the Football Team will tote their second-best passing defense into AT&T Stadium, relegating Cooper to WR3/flex status.","Akers did find the end zone in Week 11 against the Buccaneers -- the first score of his rookie season -- but he's still in a rotation of backs with both Darrell Henderson Jr. and Malcolm Brown. None of these Rams runners stand out enough to merit a start in fantasy, especially with a tough matchup against the 49ers on deck.","Extending their best start to a season in franchise history, Roethlisberger is overcoming a low average depth of target with the league's fastest release after the snap. This quick-hitting Pittsburgh passing game has become quiet dangerous, aiding Roethlisberger's case as a fringe fantasy starter this week in a tougher matchup with the Ravens.","Andy Dalton's return didn't help Gallup as he corralled just 2-of-5 targets for 29 yards in the Cowboys' Week 11 comeback win over the Vikings. With Amari Cooper and Ceedee Lamb both ahead of Gallup in the offensive pecking order, he's no longer worthy of a reserve roster spot heading into the Cowboys' Thanksgiving meeting with a tough Washington secondary.","En route to a solid line this past Sunday before suffering a season-ending knee injury in the third quarter, Burrow finishes an impressive first run through the NFL as one of just four quarterbacks in league history to produce at least five 300-yard outings in his first 10 appearances. Despite the unfortunate end to this season, Burrow is positioned as a fun fantasy option for 2021.",null,"Still quite the gem in dynasty and keeper formats, it's likely the case that Fant's ankle injury this season combined with subpar play behind center has limited his production. It's at least encouraging that Fant tallied his third-highest yardage tally of the season this past week, so there is some streaming potential for the second-year option for this upcoming matchup with a New Orleans defense that has allowed 13.4 fantasy points per game to the position.","Anderson wasn't fazed as P.J. Walker took snaps in Week 11 in the place of an injured Teddy Bridgewater. In fact, he hauled in seven balls for 46 yards in the Panthers' win over the Lions. Anderson has at least four catches in every game with Week 11's 46 yards being his second-lowest yardage total of the season. Anderson is in line for another productive effort when the Panthers draw the Vikings' vulnerable secondary in a Week 12 road affair.","For a defense that just struggled to contain Deshaun Watson both via the air and the ground, it's likely not a promising sign that a meeting with elite dual-threat quarterback Kyler Murray is on deck. Without much of a pass rush, it's best to pass on this once-dominant defense.","Hines was the offensive engine in Week 10 for the Colts against Tennessee, but shifted back to a change-of-pace role this past week against Green Bay. Will Hines regain his big role this week against the Titans? It's this uncertainty that keeps him just on the fringe of flex appeal.","Peterson \"started\" in Week 11 with D'Andre Swift sidelined, but was utilized less often than Kerryon Johnson. With the rookie likely out again, the duo will split time once more in Week 12, and Peterson should handle more ground work than Johnson. That's good news against Houston, which has allowed the most rushing yards in football this season. Peterson would be a low-end starting back if Swift remains out.",null],"13":["With QB Taysom Hill focusing more on running the ball, Thomas' Week 12 targets fell to just six. However, he did manage to latch onto four receptions for 50 yards. With a rematch against the Falcons on the Week 13 docket, Thomas' activity should increase. While me may not match Week 11's line of nine receptions for 104 yards (the first time these NFC South combatants met), Thomas should return to WR1 production.","Game script never really allowed Jacobs to get untracked in Week 12, as the Raiders trailed early and throughout the game and suffered a series of big turnovers. Reports suggest that Jacobs' ankle injury in the loss isn't too significant, suggesting he should be active for this choice matchup with a Jets defense yielding 25 fantasy points per game to backfields.","Ertz remained sidelined for the Eagles' Week 12 Monday night loss to Seattle. Even if he's able to come off the IR and play Week 13 versus the Packers, Ertz could assume a secondary role to Dallas Goedert. His track record merits flex consideration, but hopefully you can find a safer option than Julie's husband.","Cooper excelled on Thanksgiving, gobbling up 6-of-8 targets for 112 yards, including a 54-yard catch-and-trot into the end zone for his third score of the season. Next up is a trip to Baltimore for the rare Tuesday evening affair. The Ravens secondary is tied for fifth-stingiest with respect to yielding fantasy points to receivers, pushing Cooper to WR3 territory for Week 13.","Yes, Akers has scored in back-to-back games, but he's done so with snap counts hovering in the teens. The Rams are splitting time at running back between three players, so while Akers has looked the best at times in recent weeks, he's yet to launch himself into the lead role and a more fantasy-friendly and dependable status. Keep him on your bench for a potential late-season surge, but don't start him in Week 13 against the Cardinals.","With one of the lower average depth of target rates in the league, Roethlisberger has relied on a blend of efficiency and volume to drive fantasy success this season. The ceiling isn't so high this week, however, as the Washington defense has a strong pass rush and has allowed the 11th-fewest fantasy points per game to passers.","Gallup was busy on Thanksgiving, catching 6-of-8 targets for 41 yards. While his involvement in the Cowboys offense has picked up since the games immediately after Dak Prescott went down, it's still not sufficient to merit fantasy consideration. This is especially true for Week 13 as Dallas visits Baltimore for a rare Tuesday night date with a stingy Ravens secondary.",null,null,"The Denver passing game just couldn't move the ball last week with the absence of, well, a quarterback. Now that the team should regain competence behind center, Fant is positioned as a streaming option at tight end against the Chiefs if for his seam-busting upside.",null,"The Patriots blitzed Kyler Murray on 35% of his dropbacks this past Sunday, resulting in an interception and a sack when applying additional pressure on Arizona's signal-caller. The Patriots essentially needed to get creative in order to create pressure, as they rank 26th in the NFL in pressures per dropback on opposing passers. The Chargers have a leaky offensive line, but also a potent collection of skill players and a capable rookie quarterback, resulting in this group being in the streaming tier amid this final bye week of the season.","The absence of Jon Taylor and an injury to Jordan Wilkins saw Hines net 18 touches in the loss to the Titans this past week. With Taylor potentially returning to action and Wilkins' injury not considered serious, Hines is likely to resume his third-down role for this meeting with a suspect Houston defense.","Peterson handled four carries within five yards of the end zone in Week 12, and he turned two of them into touchdowns. That's what you can expect from a veteran rusher given such prime opportunities, but those chances will likely dry up when D'Andre Swift returns to action. If Swift remains out, Peterson could be a longshot flex option in the hope that he'll score again. That said, with no meaningful contributions in the passing game this season and limited yardage upside, he's not worth a start in a part-time role.",null],"14":["For the second time in three weeks, the Falcons had no answer for Thomas as he again caught nine passes, this time for 104 yards -- one more than in his Week 11 effort. While Drew Brees liked to spread the ball around, it's clear Thomas is often Taysom Hill's first read. Hill is likely to get at least one more start, landing Thomas as a high-end WR2 for the Saints' Week 15 trek to Philadelphia.","Somewhat dependent on touchdown production to deliver solid fantasy performances, Jacobs missed this past week against the Jets with ankle injury. Reports suggest Jacobs could work his way back into a meaningful for Las Vegas this week, but practice participation will likely prove key. Per this week's matchup, the Colts have been solid against the run this season, keeping Jacobs in the RB2 range if he's good to go.","After missing five games, Ertz suited up in Week 13, playing on a conservative 27 snaps. He reeled in two of his four targets for 31 yards. Despite being one of the premier tight ends coming into the season, Ertz has yet to prove he's fantasy-worthy in 2020. He will be hard-pressed to do so in Week 14 against a stingy New Orleans defense.","In Week 13, Cooper caught a TD pass for the second straight game, giving him four scores for the season. On the evening, Cooper reeled in five balls for 43 yards. Cooper's volume remains among the highest in Dallas' receiving corps, making him a WR3 in Week 14 when the Cowboys face a middle-of-the-pack Bengals secondary which is allowing the 15th-most WR fantasy points per game.","Akers surged to the top of the Rams' RB depth chart in Week 13, out-snapping both Darrell Henderson Jr. and Malcolm Brown by a wide margin. He handled 22 touches out of the backfield and scored once, coming up just shy of 100 total yards from scrimmage. The Rams seem set on making Akers their No. 1 back and the focal point of the running game, but he rarely chips in as a receiver. This hurts his fantasy upside a bit, making him more of a flex option (with RB2 upside in deeper leagues) against a strong New England defense.","After starting 11-0, the best start in franchise history, the Steelers suffered their first loss of the season on Monday. Roethlisberger was able to deliver more than 300 yards and multiple scores this past week, while his potential this week remains solid given the Bills are one of seven teams allowing at least 20 fantasy points per game to passers this season.","Gallup rose to the occasion in Week 13's  Tuesday night showcase, pacing the Cowboys across the board with seven receptions on 11 targets, amassing 86 yards and a touchdown. Despite posting his best effort since Week 3, Gallup's inconsistency doesn't merit Week 14 fantasy attention when Dallas goes on the road to play the Bengals in a short week.",null,"After being released by the Dolphins, the Eagles signed Howard, who got four carries for 19 yards in Week 13. However, Howard has since been jettisoned from the active roster and there's no indication he'll return from the practice squad for Philadelphia's Week 14 home date with New Orleans.","It's impressive to see a tight end net nearly 15 yards per catch in a game, as Fant did this past Sunday night against the Chiefs but it's still glaring that Fant hasn't hauled in a touchdown since Week 2. The Panthers have allowed nearly 14 fantasy points per game to tight ends, helping Fant's case as a low-end streaming option this week.","When the Panthers last played in Week 12, Anderson tallied his second TD pass of the season -- his first score since Week 1. Carolina resumes their schedule with a Week 14 visit from Denver. The Broncos have yielded the eighth-fewest WR fantasy points per game, but Anderson has established a target floor worthy of being started every week. Just temper your expectations to that of WR3 territory.","Return ace Gunner Olszewski had a 70-yard punt return to start the second quarter in what was an incredible performance by the Patriots' special teams in Week 13's rout of the Chargers. A tougher matchup awaits, however, as the more run-centric Rams haven't afforded many fantasy points to opposing defenses this season. This said, the Patriots clearly enter the matchup with some big-play momentum.","Having earned the trust of the staff to handle high-leverage red zone touches, Hines produced a short score against the Texans in Week 13. Yet with Jonathan Taylor taking on a heavy workload recently, Hines is a risky option even against a porous Raiders front seven.","While he hasn't caught a pass in a month, Peterson has been key for the Lions as the lead runner with D'Andre Swift out. Should Swift return, Peterson will certainly keep some of his carries, but it's the rookie who figures to be the primary option out of the Detroit backfield. However, if Swift misses out again, look to Peterson as a solid fantasy option against a Green Bay defense that allows plenty of fantasy points to opposing backs.",null],"15":["Thomas was once again Taysom Hill's primary target in Week 14 as the two connected on all eight targets for 84 yards. However, it shouldbe noted that Thomas has still not scored in the seven games he's played this season. Week 15 presents a challenge as the Saints host the Chiefs. Nevertheless, despite the Kansas City secondary yielding the 11th-fewest passing touchdowns in the league, Thomas remains one of the top options at his position.","The good news is that Jacobs returned to action this past week and handled 16 touches and tied his season high with five targets. The bad news is how ineffective he proved on these opportunities. The hope is that competitive game unfolds against the Chargers, allowing Jacobs to stay on the field plenty in early-down scenarios. With real upside in such a role, Jacobs is a solid RB2 asset for Week 15.","After being eased back into action last week, Ertz saw his usual high complement of snaps in Week 14. However, that action was as the Eagles' No. 2  tight end as Dallas Goedert remained in the lead role. Ertz grabbed two of his three targets, but for just eight yards. For those still hoping for a return of the \"old Ertz\" in their fantasy playoffs, it's time to let go of the dream.","Cooper caught only four passes in Week 14, but they accounted for 25% of Andy Dalton's completions. They also included a second-quarter 11-yard scoring strike helping the Cowboys to a 17-0 halftime advantage in their big win over Cincinnati. The big lead allowed Dallas to grind it out in the second half. Cooper checks in as a WR3 in Week 15 when the Cowboys entertain the 49ers who are yielding the ninth-fewest WR fantasy points per game.","Akers has responded to the challenge of being the top back for the Rams, racking up nearly 200 yards in his second game in a row with more than 20 touches. He's now played on 50-plus snaps in consecutive outings and appears to be in a Todd Gurley-esque role for this offense. That's great news against a struggling Jets defense, making Akers a solid RB1 in all formats.","Pittsburgh has now scored fewer than 20 points in three straight games after scoring at least 20 points in the first 10 games of the season.

As such, he's an unreliable fantasy option when the 49ers and their solid secondary pay a visit in Week 15.",null,null,"An illness kept Fant from playing much this past week, limiting him to just five snaps before exiting for good.

Next up is a Saturday date with the Packers to kickoff the Week 15 slate. Anderson remains an every-week start and should eclipse the 1,000-yard plateau for the first time in his career, despite facing a Green Bay secondary allowing the fifth-fewest WR fantasy points.","The Rams ran all over this defense last week, with Cam Akers producing the most yardage by a rookie back against the Patriots ever. The Dolphins don't quite have the backfield talent the Rams do, but there is still risk in deploying this group against an improved Miami offense.","One of the most productive change-of-pace backs in the NFL, Hines was effective as the backup to Jonathan Taylor this past week. Given the team's position as sizable favorites this week, Hines could play a smaller role in the passing phase, leaving him well outside flex territory against the Texans.","With D'Andre Swift back in action for Detroit, Peterson struggled to get anything going in his part-time role off the bench.

The hope is that game script allows him to earn a big workload this week against Denver.","Ertz was quiet for the first three quarters of Week 16's loss to the Cowboys, but quite noisy in the fourth quarter after Dallas Goedert left the game with an ankle injury. Ertz finished with three grabs (seven targets) for 33 yards. Goedert is now questionable for Week 17's Sunday night affair, putting Ertz in play. Whichever of the duo starts should play a significant role in Philadelphia's offense.","After a sluggish Week 15 effort, Cooper rebounded big time in Week 16. He hauled in four balls for 121 yards, helping the Cowboys beat the Eagles and keep their playoff hopes alive. Dallas needs to win in Week 17 to have a chance, but they'll be opposed by the Giants, also needing a win to potentially make the playoffs. Cooper will find the road a bit tougher, but he still maintains WR3 status.","Akers suffered an ankle injury in Week 16 and he'll have to play through it in Week 17, if he suits up at all. The Cardinals have a very average run defense, so this would be a fine week to start a healthy Akers. Unfortunately, with his ankle likely still to be in pain and a backup quarterback under center, it might be wise to consider other options -- assuming any are available to you.","An impressive three-touchdown showing against the Colts last week put a nice bow on another season for Roethlisberger, who is scheduled to sit out Week 17 in order to rest for the playoffs. ","Gallup took advantage of a beaten-up Eagles secondary, racking up 121 receiving yards on six receptions (including two scores) as Dallas soared over the Eagles in Week 16. Gallup has found the end zone in three of his last four games, putting him in the flex mix when Dallas visits the Giants in a crucial Week 17 contest. The victor will win the NFC East if Washington falls to Philadelphia on Sunday night.",null,null,"A team-high 20 targets the past two weeks has propelled Fant to some solid fantasy results during this sample. The Raiders, meanwhile, have been respectable in defending tight ends in allowing just shy of a dozen fantasy points per game in PPR formats. Even with the mediocre matchup metrics, a heavy workload and Fant's ability to create plays down the seam aids his case as a solid fantasy starter.","Anderson only compiled 39 receiving yards in Week 16, but he caught seven balls -- including one for a score. The former Jet will look to close out his first campaign with the Panthers on a high note when Carolina hosts New Orleans in Week 17. The Saints defense is stingy to wideouts, but Anderson's heavy weekly involvement in Carolina's offense warrants a spot in your fantasy lineup.","Youâ€™d think that even in a down season that a New England defense would still present real fantasy value in a finale against the Jets and yet you'd be wrong; the Patriots' D/ST tallied just three fantasy points against the Jets earlier this season and has produced a paltry three sacks the past three weeks.","As one of the busier change-of-pace backs in the entire league, Hines brings a relatively stable floor to the field in deeper PPR formats. Pacing for more than 60 receptions on the season thanks to regular inclusion in the screen game, Hines could enjoy another respectable day from scrimmage in facing a porous Jacksonville defense. ","The veteran hardly saw the field in Week 16's blowout loss against Tampa Bay, but will likely get a few token opportunities against his former team in Week 17. That said, there's not enough upside or passing-game involvement here to recommend Peterson as a play against the Vikings.",null],"6":[null,null,"The Steelers limited Ertz to a sole reception for six yards in Week 5. Defenses continue to focus on the tight end, forcing Carson Wentz to look to a depleted WR corps. Ertz should be getting some help soon with DeSean Jackson and Alshon Jeffery both on the mend. In the meantime, despite the recent diminished production, Ertz remains a TE1 option for Week 6 since the Ravens defense is vulnerable to tight ends.","It was clear on Sunday that the Giants did not want Cooper to beat them, as he was only able to shake free for two catches (on four targets) totaling 23 yards. Andy Dalton is now at quarterback and fellow wideouts Michael Gallup and Ceedee Lamb will continue to share in the targets. That said, with a tough Cardinals defense on the docket, Cooper should improve on last week's production even if he falls short of the level he displayed with Dak Prescott at the helm. Consider Cooper in the WR2 tier for Week 6.","Akers made the most of his limited playing time in Week 5, rushing nine times for a team-high 61 yards. That said, with no passing-game involvement and only a few handfuls of snaps each week, he's not reliable enough to place in your starting lineup. This is especially the case against a formidable San Francisco run defense.","With at least 18 fantasy points in each start this season, Roethlisberger has been a steady hand in both real and fantasy purposes after missing much of 2019. The Browns' pass rush ranks just 21st in pressuring quarterbacks this season, which should help Roethlisberger work from the pocket with his deep and emerging group of young receivers. In a game with a projected point total above 50 points on most books, there is plenty of room for Roethlisberger to match his fantasy projection in this division matchup.","Gallup caught only four balls in Week 5, but they went for 73 yards -- including two big catches down the stretch as Andy Dalton looked to Gallup during the Cowboys' game-winning drive. This doesn't mean Gallup's production will continue to grow, as he's still competing for targets with Amari Cooper, Ceedee Lamb and Ezekiel Elliott. Nevertheless, it is encouraging. However, until he exhibits a connection with Dalton, Gallup is only worth monitoring -- and not playing.","In his toughest matchup to date, it wasn't so surprising to see Burrow struggle to handle Baltimore's blitz-heavy defense in Week 5. Even as the Bengals trailed throughout, Burrow dropped back to pass on just 60% of the team's snaps, limiting any potential for fantasy fun with the game decided. This week doesn't get much easier for the rookie, as the Colts have allowed just 5.4 net yards per dropback to quarterbacks, fewest among all AFC defenses.","A dreaded healthy scratch this past Sunday has Howard surprisingly on the fringe of the Miami roster at this stage of the campaign. You can safely release Howard into fantasy free agency ahead of this week's tilt with the Jets.","A significant ankle injury will likely sideline Fant for Week 6, per ESPN's NFL Nation.","After logging an average depth of target of over 15 yards with the Jets in his first two seasons in the league, Anderson is now running much shorter routes -- with great success. He's reached triple-digit receiving yards three times, including last Sunday's 112 yard effort, which came on eight catches. The Bears have a good pass defense, but Anderson's new-found prowess underneath should keep him as a WR2.","Going from Patrick Mahomes in Arrowhead in Week 4 to hosting the Broncos' offense this week is quite the shift in matchups. New England isn't the same dominant defense from last season, but there is still great fantasy potential facing a depleted Denver offense.","Philip Rivers has a history of funneling a high share of targets to his backfield, but this tendency hasn't really surfaced to help fantasy managers in 2020. Hines is nearly evenly splitting routes with Jonathan Taylor and is a non-factor as a rusher, so even this inviting meeting with the Bengals defense isn't very intriguing.","Peterson remained the Lions' top back in Week 4, but handled only 11 touches. He salvaged a decent fantasy performance with a touchdown, but this backfield appears to be a juggling act for the coaching staff each week. As such, it's impossible to trust any of them for reliable production. That said, the Jaguars have allowed the fifth-most RB fantasy points per game this season, so Peterson is worth a spot as a flex (or perhaps an RB2 in a deep league), given the matchup

is fresh off a historic 2019 season in which he set a single-season record for receptions (149) en route to outscoring the next-closest wide receiver by 99 fantasy points. Incredibly, Thomas finished as a top-five fantasy WR nine times during his final 12 games of 2019. During his four NFL campaigns, Thomas has finished no lower than ninth in receptions, yards, catch rate and fantasy points. Thomas' massive 32.5% target share will be hard to repeat, but history suggests he'll still be in the vicinity. Couple that with the return of Drew Brees and the 27-year-old Thomas is primed for another elite performance. He's a top-five overall fantasy asset.","Jacobs returns as the feature back for the Raiders following an extremely impressive rookie campaign. The 2019 first-round pick averaged a healthy 4.75 YPC on 242 attempts and ranked fourth among backs with a 2.25 YAC. Jacobs flashed with four top-10 fantasy weeks but missed three games because of injury, and his output was capped by a limited role as a receiver (27 targets). Coach Jon Gruden has consistently expressed a desire to target Jacobs more often, which adds some optimism that Jacobs can become a workhorse back. Of course, until that actually happens, the 22-year-old is best valued as a fringe top-12 fantasy back.","Ertz had his hands full playing through injuries and double coverage last season, but the veteran tight end still managed his third consecutive campaign as a top-four fantasy tight end. Ertz hasn't finished lower than fifth in targets, sixth in receptions or seventh in yardage at the position since 2014. He's also ranked no lower than fourth in touchdowns and OTD each of the past three seasons. Third-year Dallas Goedert is looming, but Ertz enters his age-29 season as Carson Wentz's top target and remains a top-five fantasy tight end.","Cooper re-signed with the Cowboys during the offseason and returns as Dak Prescott's top target. In 2019, Cooper produced his fourth 1,000-yard season in five tries while setting career-best marks in receiving yards, touchdowns and fantasy points in his first full campaign with Dallas. Incredibly, Cooper has yet to finish a season higher than 10th in fantasy points but, in five seasons, he has managed to post four 1,000-yard seasons and three seasons in a row with seven-plus TDs. He also has finished among the top receivers in catch rate and YPT for the past two seasons. Cooper doesn't get the same amount of targets of other top-end WRs, but the 26-year-old's top-end talent -- and Dallas' high-scoring offense --secures his spot as a strong WR2.","The Rams selected Akers with the 52nd pick of April's draft. The tough and elusive Akers measures in at 5-foot-10, 217 pounds with solid speed (4.47 40-yard dash) and good strength (20 bench reps). Despite lacking some big-play ability and having to do most of his damage after contact last season (5.0 YPC, 1.7 YBC), Akers posted one of the best YAC/forced missed tackle profiles in this year's rookie class. The Florida State product will open his career in a wide-open competition with second-year back Darrell Henderson and Malcolm Brown to replace Todd Gurley. He might not do much as a receiver, but if Akers is able to claim a majority of the carries and goal-line work, he could quickly join the RB2 discussion. Grab him in the middle rounds.","Roethlisberger is back in Pittsburgh after missing all but two games due to injury last season. The last time we saw Roethlisberger for a full season, the Steelers' offense set a franchise record with 51 touchdowns in 2018. Roethlisberger paced the NFL in dropbacks (712), attempts (675) and completions (452), while finishing top-five in passing yards (5,086), passing touchdowns (34) and fantasy points (342) that season. The 38-year-old finished eighth or better in fantasy points per game in five straight seasons prior to 2019. Roethlisberger adds little with his legs, but he has a good line, an intriguing WR trio led by JuJu Smith-Schuster, and newcomer TE Eric Ebron in the fold. Consider Big Ben a top-15 option with QB1 upside.","Most would agree that Gallup is the Cowboys' No. 2 wideout behind Amari Cooper, but it's not as clear-cut as you might think. In 13 full games together last season, Gallup played on 44 more snaps and was targeted four more times than his counterpart. Both were top-10 fantasy receivers during those weeks. Gallup looks like the real deal following a breakout second season in which he posted a 66-1,107-6 receiving line and ranked ninth among wide receivers with a 16.8 YPR. The 24-year-old has solidified himself as one of Dak Prescott's go-to targets and, even though his workload could drop slightly with CeeDee Lamb in the mix, he could make up for some of that with more usage near the goal line. He had only three end-zone targets last season. Consider Gallup as a borderline WR3.","The Bengals selected Burrow with the No. 1 pick of April's draft. Burrow doesn't have the strongest arm, but he is extremely accurate and has good size (6-foot-3, 221 pounds), playmaking ability and mobility. The LSU product completed 76% of his passes, registered as off target on 7.7% of his throws and posted a 94.9 total QBR during the 2019 season, all of which were best in this year's rookie class. Burrow also adds value with his legs (368 rushing yards, 5 TDs), which only adds to his fantasy upside. Burrow will be a Week 1 starter, but as is the norm for rookie passers, he's a long shot to reach QB1 status in 2020.","Howard signed with the Dolphins following four seasons with Chicago and Philadelphia. The 2016 fifth-round pick has racked up 3,895 rushing yards in his four pro seasons, which trails only the totals of Ezekiel Elliott and Todd Gurley for most during that span. Howard is obviously a very effective rusher but has struggled as a receiver, averaging an ugly 5.4 yards per play on 119 career targets. A top-20 fantasy back during his first three seasons, Howard might struggle to get back to that territory as he operates as an early-down and goal-line complement to Matt Breida in Miami. The 25-year-old hammer is a borderline flex option in non-PPR leagues.","The Broncos selected Fant in the first round of last year's draft and proceeded to put him on the field for 68% of their offensive snaps. That's a healthy number for a 21-year-old rookie, as was Fant's TE16 fantasy campaign. The Iowa product was a game-changer with the ball in his hands, pacing 41 qualified tight ends with an 8.3 RAC. His 562 receiving yards rank sixth and his 8.9 YPT fifth among rookie tight ends since 2007. Fant's usage actually declined quite a bit in December, but there's little doubt he's a strong candidate for a big second-year leap as one of Drew Lock's top targets. Fant has elite upside and should be on your radar in the middle rounds.","Following four seasons with the Jets, Anderson signed with Carolina during the offseason. Anderson went undrafted in 2016, but went on to appear in 62 of 64 games with New York, hauling in 206 passes for 3,034 yards and 20 touchdowns. Anderson was limited to one strong fantasy campaign (18th in 2017) and finished 39th and 40th in the past two seasons. In Anderson's defense, a position-high 33% of balls thrown his direction were 'off target' last season. In Carolina, the 26-year-old vertical threat will work alongside DJ Moore and Curtis Samuel in Matt Rhule's new-look offense led by QB Teddy Bridgewater. Consistency is unlikely with Christian McCaffrey as the focal point of the Panthers' offense, so Anderson is safest as a borderline flex play in deeper leagues.","The Patriots were the top-scoring fantasy D/ST by a massive 34 points last season. No D/ST has finished No. 1 in the category in back-to-back seasons over the past decade, but New England has been very reliable under Bill Belichick, ranking in the top 10 seven of the past eight seasons. Last season's unit was incredible, ranking first or second in INTs, yardage allowed, points allowed, D/ST touchdowns and forced turnovers. Though we should expect another solid campaign, keep in mind that the Patriots already regressed from their early 2019 dominance, ranking as the No. 12 D/ST from Week 9 on. The unit also had a rough offseason, losing and not completely replacing key performers Kyle Van Noy, Jamie Collins, Duron Harmon and Danny Shelton. A stacked secondary led by Stephon Gilmore and Devin McCourty remains in place, but we should expect a return to midrange starter production from this unit in 2020.","Marlon Mack and Jonathan Taylor are the Colts' primary ball carriers, but it's Hines who has been handling passing situations. The 2018 fourth-round pick ranked eighth among backs in routes and seventh in targets with Andrew Luck in 2018 before falling to 27th and 16th, respectively, with Jacoby Brissett last season. Hines' receiving efficiency has been a problem (career 5.3 YPT and nine drops), and his 190-pound frame hasn't allowed him much volume or efficiency as a rusher (3.7 YPC on 137 career carries) or in the scoring department (six career TDs). Perhaps Philip Rivers will inject some life into Hines' fantasy stock, but the third-year back will need to significantly improve his game. He's worth only a late flier in PPR.","Peterson was released by Washington just prior to Week 1. Peterson ranked 17th among running backs with 898 rushing yards last season but didn't score much (five TDs) and was a nonfactor as a receiver (23 targets). Peterson is still an effective rusher at age 35, but the reigning No. 33 scoring fantasy back had zero top-10 fantasy weeks in 2019 and is a strong bet for a significant decrease in touches in 2020 regardless of landing spot.

<h3>Get all players from all teams</h3>
<p>To extract the players for each team, we first need to know how many players are on each team each week. One might think this is consistent, but with an IR slot, this may change from week to week.</p>
<p>First we create a function to determine how many roster spots are on a given team.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_roster_slots &lt;- function(team_number=1){
  return(tibble(team_number = team_number, player_slot = 1:length(ESPNFromJSON$teams$roster$entries[[team_number]]$playerPoolEntry$player$stats)))
}</code></pre>
<p>Then we map that over all teams.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>team_player_slots &lt;- purrr::map_dfr(1:number_of_teams,~get_roster_slots(team_number = .x))

team_player_slots</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 182 x 2
##    team_number player_slot
##          &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;
##  1           1           1
##  2           1           2
##  3           1           3
##  4           1           4
##  5           1           5
##  6           1           6
##  7           1           7
##  8           1           8
##  9           1           9
## 10           1          10
## # ... with 172 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Now, we map the <code>team_number</code> and <code>player_slots</code> data to the <code>player_extract()</code> function to get every player from every team.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>team_list &lt;- 
  purrr::map2_dfr(
    team_player_slots$team_number,
    team_player_slots$player_slot, 
    ~player_extract(
