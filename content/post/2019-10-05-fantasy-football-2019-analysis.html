<h2>The Goal of this Analysis</h2>
<p>I am a stereotypical bad fantasy football manager. My motivation for this analysis is to show how I’m unlucky.</p>
<p>Below I summarize how I got the data, the information I can glean from the data, share the link to this analysis for my league, and share the code so you can do it to.</p>

<h2>ESPN Fantasy Football Analysis: How To Get The Data</h2>
<p>This is the final (maybe) of a series of posts where I am chronologicaling my process of accessing and analyzing ESPN’s fantasy football data using my league as an example.</p>
<p>First, I explained how I accessed ESPN’s fantasy football data in public leagues using their new V3 API <a href="https://dusty-turner.netlify.com/post/espn-fantasy-football-v3-api-an-r-solution/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Next, I mimicked <a href="https://twitter.com/thestevemo">thestevemo</a>’s <a href="https://stmorse.github.io/journal/espn-fantasy-v3.html">blogpost</a> in accessing private league data. I wasn’t having success in R so I used reticulate and <a href="https://dusty-turner.netlify.com/post/espn-fantasy-football-v3-api-for-private-leagues-python-through-r/">made it happen</a>.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a href="https://twitter.com/nickryanpaul">nickryanpaul</a> helped me figure out how to <a href="https://dusty-turner.netlify.com/post/espn-fantasy-football-v3-api-for-private-leagues-an-r-solution-finally/">access the API</a> using R.</p>

<h2>League Analysis</h2>
<p><a href="https://dusty-turner.netlify.com/fantasyfootball2019/fantasy-football-league-dashboard">League Analysis Dashboard</a></p>
<p>So far, I’ve built this to do the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Identify the top and bottom teams every week. In my league we give a mug to the top points scorer and a plunger for the bottom dweller.</p></li>
<li><p>Show a graphic to see who is over performing (or under performing) according to their record.</p></li>
<li><p>Analyse whose players are over/under performing according to ESPN’s projections. Another way to look at this is examining how accurate ESPN’s projections are. Along with this - If every team played their optimal lineup, what would their record be.</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, I created a couple of miscellaneous observations. I created a histogram of how accurate ESPN’s predictions are by position. Also, I created a radar chart to show how each team ranks in scoring at each position compared to the other teams.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I plan to add more as the season progresses (and I have time).</p>

<div id="team-by-team-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Team By Team Analysis</h2>
<p>For each team, I created a markdown report analyzing their performance. Here is the analysis I currently have for each team:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Short league summary depicting if the selected team earned the top (or bottom) points scorer award.</p></li>
<li><p>A visualization showing how well each player performed according to their expectation. Also a sortable table of this graphic.</p></li>
<li><p>A listing of the optimal lineup and how badly the manager missed this lineup.</p></li>
<li><p>A radar chart showing how well each position performed compared to all previous weeks.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the most current analysis for each team.</p>

<p>Please provide any feedback you may have. How could I make this better? What else could I analyse?</p>
