<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Like many, COVID-19 completely altered our lives as the virus spread across the country and became a mainstay in our society. Though my family and I have been spared of tragedy, we’ve had to find ways to replace kid’s activities, work routines, and social interactions with other (hopefully) enriching activities… Like family games.</p>

Ticket to Ride caused a lot of strife between my kids :)

</center>
<p>One thing that we’ve added to our new normal is watching <a href="https://twitter.com/PriceIsRight?s=20">“The Price is Right”</a> after dinner. We find it to be a great chance to open up talk of numbers and strategy with our kids.</p>
<p>If executed properly, a contestant can improve their chances of getting on stage, winning games, and making it to the showcase showdown by making shrewd decisions.</p>
<p>In this blog, we look at spinning the big wheel.</p>
</div>
<div id="spinning-the-wheel" class="section level2">
<h2>Spinning the Wheel</h2>
<p>In the price is right, the first three contestants (and second three) go head-head-head in spinning the big wheel. The player with the highest sum of two spins without going over a dollar win and move on to the showcase showdown.</p>
<p>The decision each player makes is whether or not to spin a second time after their first spin.</p>

<p>The strategy is pretty simple for players two and three.</p>
<div id="rd-player" class="section level4">
<h4>3rd Player</h4>
<ul>
<li>After first spin, if you aren’t winning, spin again.<br />
</li>
<li>If you are tied after the first spin, spin again if you are less than .5 as your chances of not busting yet being over the previous player is better than .5 (which is the probability of winning on a spin off).<br />
</li>
<li>If you are tied after the first spin, do not spin again if you are greater than .5 as your chances of busting are greater than .5 (which is the probability of winning on a spin off).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="nd-player" class="section level4">
<h4>2nd Player</h4>
<ul>
<li>After first spin, if you aren’t winning, spin again.<br />
</li>
<li>If you are winning after the first spin, spin again if you are less than .5 - as the probability of the next player getting a high spin than you is whatever your number is.<br />
</li>
<li>If you are winning after the first spin, don’t spin again if you are greater than .5 - as the probability of the next player getting a higher spin than you is less than .5.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="st-player" class="section level4">
<h4>1st Player</h4>
<p>This is a different story. While we could work out the math, it is a little more complicated. While I’ve never been afraid of a little math, I’d much rather simulate.</p>
<p>I’ll talk though my logic below and show my code. I do this so the reader can see my thought process and learn something or, more preferably, point out flaw in logic or propose cleaner or more succinct ways to code this.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="simulation" class="section level2">
<h2>Simulation</h2>
<p>In this analysis, I will play out 100,000 games where the first player only spins once. Then I will play out 100,000 games where the first player spins twice. Then I will summarize the results to see how often player 1 wins if they chose to spin a second time at each value of their first spin.</p>
<p>As a quick aside, lets hope you are never as unlucky as this player.</p>

<div id="simulate-one-game" class="section level3">
<h3>Simulate One Game</h3>
<p>To support the simulation, I…</p>
<ul>
<li>…create a function that will create the result of a single showcase showdown. This function has an option for the first player to spin only once or twice.<br />
</li>
<li>… summarize the results of the spins. We’ll determine the probability of player 1 winning whether they spin once or twice at each value of initial spin.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will place comments in code to explain what is happening.</p>

<p>You can see from this example, player 1 wins because player 2 and player 3 busted. Along with this we maintain the information about the value of each individual spin.</p>

<p>Next, I’ll simulation 100,000 iterations of player 1 spinning once and 100,000 iterations of player 1 spinning twice and bind the rows together. You can see how long it took my computer with 8 threads to complete this task.</p>

<p>We can start to get a feel for the break point for when the first player should spin again.</p>

<h3>Visualize</h3>
<p>Lets look at it visually.</p>

<p>As you can see from the plot, the simulation shows that the first spin value at which you should hold vs spin again is .65. This is a rather surprising and unsettling realization. Many people would call a first contestant crazy for spinning again at .60 but this is what the data shows.</p>
<p>Taking a second look at this, we can reach the same conclusion via a heat map showing how the probability of winning on the big wheel balances out at about the .65 mark.</p>
