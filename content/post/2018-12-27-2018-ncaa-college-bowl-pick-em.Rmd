## Bowl Season!

The new and improved version of my NCAA College Bowl Pick'em Shiny App is available below.  

Incorporated this year are a few (transparent) things.

1. Bowl selections automatically lock once they start.

2. Bowl results automatically update once they are complete.

3. Multiple scoring techniques (weighted by confidence and raw).

4. Analysis of everyone's picks.

Enjoy!
