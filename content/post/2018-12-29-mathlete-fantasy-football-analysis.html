<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In my previous <a href="https://dusty-turner.netlify.com/post/espn-yahoo-api-navigation/">post</a>, I worked through how to get your league information from the ESPN and YAHOO APIs.</p>
<p>The motivation for this project was to compare two leagues performances over the 2018 fantasy football season. As the ring leader of the West Point Department of Mathematical Sciences fantasy football league, we had 20 managers. This, of course, is too many for one league so we split the teams across two leagues. I managed an ESPN league, and a colleague managed a yahoo league.</p>
<p>This post will pick up where last post left off and do some analysis between the two leagues.</p>
<p>I am not sharing my code to improve readability. If you are interested in the code for this script, send me a note, as I am happy to share.</p>

<h1>The Data</h1>
<p>The data I use for this post comes from two leages - one from yahoo and one from ESPN. Here it is below.</p>

<h1>Awards</h1>
<p>Every week, we hand out prizes for the highest overall point total and lowest.</p>
<div id="highest-weekly-point-total" class="section level2">
<h2>Highest Weekly Point Total</h2>
<p>The prizes for the highest points across both leagues is the honor of posessing the “Mug of my Mug” for the week. Yes, as you can see below, it is a mug with a picture of my face. The extra great thing about this mug, as you may be able to see, is I took it concussed with a fractured face. I earned my concussion and facial fracture in a softball colision. Yes, I was called out…</p>
<p><img src="/mug.JPG" /><!-- --></p>
<!-- So who are the weekly highest scorers?   -->
<p>Now, who wins the mug each week?</p>
</div>
<div id="lowest-weekly-point-total" class="section level2">
<h2>Lowest Weekly Point Total</h2>
<p>In a similar vein, we awarded the coveted (not so much) plunger for the manager who scored the least points each week.</p>
<p>Here are the plunger winners.</p>

<h1>Which Leagues are better?</h1>
<p>Lets look at several metric.</p>

<div id="who-is-good-and-who-is-lucky" class="section level1">
<h1>Who is good, and who is lucky?</h1>
<p>One of the more frustrating things in fantasy football is to score a ton of points, only to play the team who scores the most in your league. Lets look at some measures of luck.</p>
<div id="who-played-the-most-mugs" class="section level2">
<h2>Who played the most mugs?</h2>
<p>Those poor stampeders just couldn’t catch a break!</p>
</div>
<div id="who-played-the-most-plungers" class="section level2">
<h2>Who played the most plungers?</h2>
<p>Man, I wish I could catch some luck. Good work Big Gronkowski for beating down the little guys…</p>
</div>
<div id="overall-points-scored-vs-winning-percentage" class="section level2">
<h2>Overall Points Scored vs Winning Percentage</h2>
<p>First, who had the highest winning percentage?</p>
<p>And on that note, who scored the most and lest points?</p>
<p>With that, how did this play out with overall wins and losses?</p>
<p>It looks like Gosset’s T-Down scored a lot and had a lot of points scored against him. Its impressive he pulled off 11 wins.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Brady for President scored a lot of points but only had a moderate amount scored against him - This is probably what allowed him to win 12 games.</p>
<p>However, Last Man Standin and The Big Gronkowski didn’t have that many points scored against them, so they made up for it by not scoring that many points themselves. That was nice of you guys.</p>
