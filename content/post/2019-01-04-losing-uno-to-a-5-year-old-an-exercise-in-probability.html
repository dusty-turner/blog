<h1>Background</h1>
<p>On of my son’s favorite games he received for Christmas this year is UNO Attack. If you are not familiar with the rules, you can get up to speed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_Attack">here</a>. In short, the rules are no different than usual UNO except when you cannot play, instead of taking a card, you press a button on an UNO card shooting contraption. Most of the time you get no cards, but some of the time it will “attack” with 1 or more cards. Tons of fun.</p>

<div id="section-the-problem" class="section level1">
<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>While all four of us in my family love to play this game (ages 3, 5, 34, and <em>redacted</em>), my 5 year old son does not like to lose (who does really?).</p>
<p>I asked him, out of four games, how many he should expect to win. His answer of “1” showed his intuitive understanding of expected value. When I asked him if it anyone should be surprised if they didn’t win 1 out of 4. His answer of “no” shows that he even has an intuitive understanding of variance. Proud Dad.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-solution" class="section level1">
<h1>The Solution</h1>
<p>So we did an exercise in probability. What is the probability that he would lose “x” amount of games given each player had a 25% chance of winning.</p>

<p>No so unlikely that he (or any of us) would lose 4 in a row… It did little to console him. Especially when his 3 year old sister won 1 of those games. It didn’t seem to bother him that mom won the other 3….</p>

<h1>The Fun</h1>
<p>In my efforts to make this more real to him, I created this shiny app. If nothing else, he like watching the colors move.</p>
