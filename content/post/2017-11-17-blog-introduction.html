<p>As my experience with statistics, computer science, and the all encompasing term, data science, increases, I have decided that it is time to share some of my projects.</p>
<p>Creating this blog serves several purposes.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It archives some things I’ve created.</li>
<li>It makes my work public so I can receive (hopefully) constructive feedback to improve my tools/analysis.<br />
</li>
<li>It helps me share what I’ve learned with the community that has been so helpful to me.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you for visiting!</p>
