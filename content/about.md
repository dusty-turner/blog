I am a husband to Jill and a dad to Cal and Reese.  I've spent 10 years in the Army and currently teach at The United States Military Academy at West Point, NY. 

While I teach statistics, Data Science has become my hobby.  I hope to improve my skills in statistics, machine learning, and computer science to make improvments within the Army and to the world at large.
