What follows is a growing collection of examples of why I am grateful to be a part of this community.

I met [@jaredlander](https://twitter.com/jaredlander) at the 2017 [MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/people/jared-lander/).  He gave a phenominal talk (except for the focus on the NY Giants), and he was gracious in his conversation afterwards.  We've had several interactions in the ensuing months -- What a great mentor!

As a relatively 'new' data scientist, I am grateful for leaders in the comunity who have this attitude.  I have been a beneficiary of the patience of others and am grateful when I have the chance to pay it forward to others.
